<h3>Ozark’s Forum Rules</h3>


<ol>

<li>No bigots. No tolerance for the intolerant.

<li>Racism is an auto-ban. No one cares if you’re “just joking.”

<li>Trans rights are human rights.

<li>We are strictly anti-facist.

<li>No bootlickers.

<li>Auto-ban for anyone who willingly invades the safe spaces we have set up for a variety of marginalized identities.

<li>If you’re questioning whether or not to spoiler-warning something, just do it. This includes images and possibly triggering material. 

<li>Forum moderators are not special or given unique privileges. They are the garbage collectors of the site. They clean up messes and help enforce bans. We cycle through moderators every few months.

<li>Similarly, devs are not given special privileges within the community. This is your space. We have our own spaces just for us elsewhere. 

<li>We are liberal with the ban button. No one’s got time for that.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These rules were originally written by Clarence Ozark for the .dungeon discussion boards, and have been edited slightly over the years.
</p>
<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>


<p>
<strong>RPG - </strong>Roleplaying Game. What you’re reading now and will be playing soon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Annwn </strong>- The world of .dungeon. Also the name of the “sad god” in the game’s lore.
</p>
<p>
<strong>MMO </strong>- Massively Multiplayer Online game. World of Warcraft is probably still the cultural touchstone. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Virtual World </strong>- Everything inside the game of .dungeon. The world of the game itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>IRL </strong>- “In Real Life.” Everything outside the game. The world we live in right now. The world where we sit to play the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Set of Dice </strong>- The standard set of dice includes a d20, a d12, two d10’s, a d8, a d6, and a d4.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dice Chain</strong> - “The Chain.” The set of dice in ascending order, from d4 to d20. Going up the chain means using the next largest dice (you can’t go past a d20). Going down the chain means using the next smallest dice (below a d4 is 0, meaning instant failure). 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Player Characters </strong>- The people you are playing the game with, either at the table, over voice chat, or through text. Often called “Players,” or “PCs.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Avatar </strong>- The virtual character you create to explore the virtual world. Exists only in the virtual world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>PUGS </strong>- “Players Unknown.” GM-controlled players. Fictional people who exist IRL and create Avatars to explore the virtual world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Entity </strong>- Every object, NPC, and mob in the game. If it’s inside the game, it’s an entity. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>NPC </strong>- Non-Player Characters. Pieces of code within the game with predetermined dialog and interactions. Not real people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mob </strong>- Hostile entities. Monsters. Creatures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>RNG </strong>- Random Number Generator. A short hand for “random chance” or luck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Role </strong>- Traditionally called a “Class” in RPGs. Grants your avatar bonuses while playing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aspect </strong>- An ability that references the real world. The fictional VR headset used to play the game scans you and your environment to allow cross contamination. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bytes </strong>- The currency of .dungeon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Supplies </strong>- An expendable resource. Used for travel and upkeep. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Materials </strong>- An expendable resource. Used for crafting and building.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Upkeep </strong>- The cost to use and maintain certain entities like pets, vehicles, and structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Target</strong> - An entity being attacked by a weapon or spell is that ability’s “target.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Field of Battle</strong> - Everything targetable by melee, spell, or ranged attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Area</strong> - All entities and spaces that are within melee range of the target.
</p>
<p>
Character Sheet: 
</p>
<h3>Help Menu</h3>


<p>
At any time, you can pause your game to take a step back and collect yourself. When the game is paused, nothing can harm your character and your avatar is temporarily removed from the situation until you unpause.
</p>
<p>
	In the Help Menu you can adjust things like difficulty, graphics, and audio, setting the game to better fit your needs. Lowering the graphical fidelity removes the aesthetic gore. Changing the difficulty will help guide your character to content you will enjoy. And audio settings can be altered to enable in-game hints or remove the sometimes-overwhelming original soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
You can also save your game state and return at a different time, or just exit the game and return to your last checkpoint. This is helpful if the situation you find yourself in is too overwhelming. Remember! If you do not have a previous checkpoint, you can always return to Tutorial Town through the main menu. 
</p>
<h3>The Server Host</h3>


<p>
To create a server in .dungeon, one player takes on the role of Server Host (sometimes called a Game Master in other games). Their job is to run the world’s Entities—its mobs, NPCs, and objects, hostile or otherwise—making sure they react appropriately to the PCs’ actions. The Host will run dungeons, give rewards for quests, and roleplay as the PUGS gaming in Annwn. Later chapters in this book will have all the tips you need to be a Server Host! For now, gather your friends and just start playing. Tutorial Town will walk you through everything you need and teach you how to run the game while your friends learn to play.
</p>
<h2 id="tutorial_town">Tutorial Town</h2>


<p>
Welcome to the start of your journey into .dungeon! Tutorial Town is the safest, most beautiful island in Annwn, where new players create their characters, learn the ropes, and take the ferry to begin their adventure (keep an eye out for Nix, the cuddly ferryman). Explore the shops and party up with fellow newbies to take on the wolf cave on the coast. Ask the NPCs around town if they need help with anything. And watch out for the slimes in the basement (wink wink)! 
</p>
<p>
<strong>How to Begin</strong>
</p>
<p>
The following pages will walk you through not only character creation, but all the basic rules of the game. This adventure is newb-friendly and will instill you with the confidence to carry on any campaign you wish within Annwn. As with many great stories, yours starts when…
</p>
<h3>You Awake in a Dungeon</h3>

<p>
The tutorial dungeon exists in the ruins beneath the church at the center of the island. The sad voice of Annwn herself guides and watches over new players who have fallen into this world. 
</p>
<h4 id="room1">Room 1</h4>


<p>
You awake in an open cage. A broken key in the lock. Annwn’s voice echoes from above, “Welcome to our world. Take your time. Don’t be afraid.”
</p>
<p>
The cage sits in a cupped palm beneath an orrery of 12 hand signs, all rotating around a giant, glowing eye. 
</p>
<h5>The Hand</h5>

<p>
After being severed, the left hand of Annwn joined the Sun in the sky as a celestial body. The largest of .dungeon’s natural satellites, it rotates on a constantly shifting axis which puts it in varying degrees of eclipse with the Sun.
</p>
<h5>Starting Gifts</h5>

<p>
At your feet is your gift, determined by your birth month and its corresponding hand sign. This is all you were left with.
</p>
<p>
<strong>January </strong>- Horse - Emerald Pendant. Restore 1 Sync every time you log in.
</p>
<p>
<strong>February </strong>- Bull - Healing Foil (3). Each card heals d6 Sync, but tears after use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>March </strong>- Crow - Skeleton Foil. Unlocks any one lock. Tears after use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>April </strong>- Hound - Death Foil. Stops your first respawn. Tears after use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>May </strong>- Frog - Fire Foil. Insert into a weapon to deal +3 fire damage for the encounter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>June </strong>- Elephant - Light Foil. Gain a guiding light to safety. Tears after use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>July </strong>- Wolf - Dungeon Foil. Removes you and one ally from a dungeon or encounter. Tears after use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>August </strong>- Cub - Hafgan’s Foil. Heals all statuses for you and all allies. Tears after use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>September </strong>- Butterfly - Lon. A floating orb creature that can hold one item for you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>October </strong>- Goose - Firebombs (3). Each bomb destroys 3 d4’s from an encounter when used.
</p>
<p>
<strong>November </strong>- Fox - Lucky Foil. Reroll one RNG roll. Tears after use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>December </strong>- Snake - Bag of Wealth. Start with 3 extra Bytes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> <em>Ask your players for their birth month and tell them only that relevant information. They’ll ask for more if they want it. No need to bog the game down with lore.</em>
</p>
<h4 id="room2">Room 2</h4>


<p>
Painted statues of .dungeon’s polyhedral pantheon: The d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. These are the organs of Annwn, left behind as she tore herself apart. Assign them to your stats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> <em>Lay the polyhedral set of dice out in front of the players and have them physically assign them to the Stats on their character sheets.</em>
</p>
<h5>Stats</h5>

<p>
You bring four stats with you into the virtual world. These are your real-world traits. Assign four of your dice to them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Build </strong>- System mastery, character optimization, the crunch of the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meta </strong>- Knowledge of the game, its setting, and its development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Presence </strong>- Your senses, charisma, and immersion in the virtual world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hands </strong>- Your reaction time, hand-eye coordination, and precision.
</p>
<h5>Tilt</h5>


<p>
Assign one of the two remaining dice to Tilt.How you keep your cool when the virtual world is unfair. Other RPGs call this a “save” or a “saving throw.” Whenever your character would take on a status effect, roll your Tilt dice. Getting a 4 or over is a success, avoiding the status.
</p>
<h5>RNG</h5>


<p>
Place your remaining dice in RNG. Also known as “luck” in other RPGs, RNG rolls are done for random events, loot drops, and other acts of chance the Server needs to account for. You can also roll RNG against an NPC to see if they are nearby, or to determine who gets targeted by the dragon’s fire attack.
</p>
<h5>The Organs of Annwn</h5>


<p>
The pantheon of .dungeon. Named after and created by the original seven members of the development team. When a statue is approached, Annwn’s echoing voice recites its lore.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Body</strong>
</p>
<p>
The icosahedron (d20). Annwn’s body. Where your adventures take place. Her body tumbles through space, each face casting itself into the aether.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dylaxis Might</strong>
</p>
<p>
The dodecahedron (d12). The spirit of the sad god. Creator of the twelve archbugs, which could never be patched.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arawn & Hafgan</strong>
</p>
<p>
The decahedrons (d10’s). The twin kings of Annwn. Arawn became the Drowned King, his castle flooded for eternity. Hafgan was hunted and slain by the Three Fingers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orion</strong>
</p>
<p>
The octahedron (d8). The eight eyes of the sad god. Protector of the realm and creator of the eight construct mobs that still spawn today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Immuno</strong>
</p>
<p>
The hexahedron (d6). The mind of the sad god. Coded the Ideas, the six most powerful spells and items of .dungeon. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Goro</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Tetrahedron (d4). The heart of the sad god. Her four sides are pained, angry, violent, and hungry. 
</p>
<h4 id="room3">Room 3</h4>


<p>
Stone bricks erode into ruins. A tree clips through the floor and bends into the wall. The beautiful voice returns…
</p>
<p>
“Our world is more dangerous than yours. You’ll need to use your knowledge and skills from your world to make it through.”
</p>
<p>
Sit beneath the tree and look into its branches to see a 3rd person view of your IRL self wearing the VR headset. Fill in your “Job” on your character sheet and select a skill that goes with it or is adjacent to it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> <em>For detailed information on the Skills, turn to [page number]. Ask your players to look at the skills on their character sheet and choose the one that sounds most related to their real-world job, career, or hobby. Give them the detailed information if they ask.</em>
</p>
<h4 id="room4">Room 4</h4>


<p>
A goblin fumbles with spears on the barracks wall. They clang and clash onto the floor. A garden grows from the walls. When the door opens from Room 3, the goblin is startled and attacks!

<strong>DICE -</strong> Monsters are dice! In a contest, roll its dice. If it loses, the dice is removed. When a monster has no dice, it’s dead.

<p>
<strong>BONUS</strong> <strong>-</strong> If a monster has bonuses to contests, they’re listed here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>INIT -</strong> Initiative. PCs have to roll over this to go before the monster in combat!
</p>
<p>
<strong>MORALE - </strong>PCs have to roll over this to communicate with the mob(s). Mobs have to roll over it when making a morale check.
</p>
<p>
<strong>DROPS - </strong>Unique drops are listed here!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Turn-Based Combat Basics</strong>
</p>
<p>
When the goblin attacks, determine turn order by rolling initiative. Each player rolls their HANDS dice and compares their number to the goblin’s Initiative: Rolling over means you go first, tying or going under means you go after the goblin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Choose your weapon!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Most weapon differences are purely cosmetic. Each PC can find any weapon they can imagine here (and one quiver), but all the weapons from this room are made of wood. [See page xx for more info on weapons.]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Melee Weapons</strong>
</p>
<p>
Simple weapons are one-handed swords, folding knives, gauntlets, brass knuckles, walking sticks and other such weapons. Greater weapons are buster swords, katanas, scythes, big pairs of scissors, double sided blades, and other such weapons. 
</p>
<p>
To attack with melee, roll BUILD + Melee against the Goblin’s d4 (this is called a Contest). Win and the goblin is destroyed. If you lose, subtract the difference from your Sync (this is called taking damage).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ranged Weapons</strong>
</p>
<p>
Ranged weapons are crossbows, longbows, blow darts, throwing stars, and other such ranged weaponry. You cannot use a ranged weapon while in melee with another combatant. All ranged weapons need quivers. Quivers are depleted by the end of each session and must be replaced/replenished with bytes. 
</p>
<p>
To attack with ranged, roll HANDS + Accuracy against the Goblin’s d4. Win and the goblin is destroyed. If you lose, subtract the difference from your Sync.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Damage Type</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your damage type is determined by the aesthetic of your weapon. Make note of what damage type your weapon does: either slashing (swords), piercing (spears/arrows), or smashing (hammers).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sync</strong>
</p>
<p>
Everyone shares one pool of Sync that starts at 100. It’s reduced every time a player takes damage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Damage</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mobs are made out of dice. When it's their turn in initiative, roll a mob’s dice to deal that damage directly to the party’s Sync.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Loot</strong>
</p>
<p>
When you defeat a mob, roll RNG to see what it drops!
</p>
<p>
1-4. 1 Byte
</p>
<p>
5-6. D4 Bytes
</p>
<p>
7-8. 1 Resource
</p>
<p>
9-10. 1 Material
</p>
<p>
11-12. D6 Bytes
</p>
<p>
13-15. D4 Resources
</p>
<p>
16-19. D4 Materials
</p>
<p>
20+. A Foils pack
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> <em>After you leave this dungeon, when the PCs encounter mobs and NPCs, roll on the reaction table to see how they respond to the Players.</em> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>d20 - Reaction</strong>
</p>
<p>
1-2. Angry about something
</p>
<p>
3-8. Cautious and avoidant
</p>
<p>
9-14. Indifferent
</p>
<p>
15-19. Cautious but curious
</p>
<p>
20+. Friendly
</p>
<h4 id="room5">Room 5</h4>


<p>
A cylindrical room carved with glorious champions sporting various y2k aesthetics. Three pillars sit in the center of the room, illuminated by light cutting in from the ruined roof. The pillars hold a shield, a sword, and a staff respectively.
</p>
<p>
The beautiful voice floats down once again. “Power sleeps within you. If you give it form, it will give you strength.”
</p>
<p>
When a pillar is approached, the voice speaks about its Role.
</p>
<p>
Sword: “The power of the fighter. Brute strength. Is this the power you seek?”
</p>
<p>
Shield: “The protection of the companion. Calming presence. Is this the power you seek?”
</p>
<p>
Staff: “The majesty of the spirit. Blessed healer. Is this the power you seek?”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Roles</strong>
</p>
<p>
Roles grant you in-game abilities or bonuses. 
</p>
<p>
Sword - DPS
</p>
<p>
All combat rolls count as +1. 
</p>
<p>
Shield - Tank
</p>
<p>
Once per encounter you can reduce incoming Sync damage to you or a party member by d6. 
</p>
<p>
Staff - Support
</p>
<p>
All healing you do or take counts as +2. This counts for items, magical effects, and Rest Dice.
</p>
<p>
When a role is selected, the voice says “Your path is set,” and opens the door to the next room.
</p>
<h4 id="room6">Room 6</h4>


<p>
A circular dining room, dominated by a large table carved from a mighty stone. Foods and drinks mold into beautiful arrangements. 8 Goblins pick their teeth with the bones of previous adventures, lit by a wax-crusted chandelier hanging from a rusted chain above. Roll initiative!

<strong>Sidebar:</strong> <em>Remember! In the future, you will roll a Reaction Roll when encountering a mob or NPC.</em>
</p>
<h5>Contests</h5>


<p>
Contests are what dice rolls are called in .dungeon. You might see or hear “roll a Melee Contest” or “Contest the goblin’s initiative.” That just means to roll your Stat dice + a relevant skill against either an opponent's dice or a static number decided by the Server.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> Combat reminders!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Initiative - </strong>Roll HANDS against the Goblins Initiative.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Melee - </strong>Roll BUILD + Melee vs an enemy’s dice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ranged - </strong>Roll HANDS + Accuracy vs an enemy’s dice.
</p>
<h5>Teamwork</h5>


<p>
Two or more players can work together on a contest, rolling their dice and choosing the higher one to compare against the Server. Remember! Mobs can do the same to you.
</p>
<h5>Stunts</h5>


<p>
When you succeed in a contest against a hostile mob, you can choose to do a stunt to it instead of destroying one of their dice. Stunts allow you to disarm, trip, or grapple your opponent. Remember! They can do the same to you.
</p>
<h5>How Do Monsters Attack?</h5>


<p>
Monsters deal damage directly to the party’s Sync. When initiative reaches the monster, roll one die per type of monster (so even if there are 10 goblins, just roll one die to represent them all) and deal that much Sync damage. This damage can be mitigated by Defense and shields.
</p>
<p>
When the goblins are defeated, two doors are revealed. One to Room 7, and one to Room 9. 
</p>
<h4 id="room7">Room 7</h4>


<p>
A regal bedroom, filled with wilting, wooden furniture. Across from the king bed is a floor-to-ceiling mirror. Standing in front of the mirror allows you to customize your avatar and select one of the starting origins if you so desire.
</p>
<p>
There’s an illusory wall here hiding a door to Room 8.
</p>
<h5>Avatar</h5>


<p>
Use the variety of sliders to adjust aspects of your avatar’s appearance, including color, hair, eyes, limbs, and body type. Since .dungeon was created in the late 90’s, its aesthetics have stayed there and in the early-2000’s. 
</p>
<h4 id="room8">Room 8</h4>


<p>
An altar for the Three Fingers. A spit of sunlight falls in through a crack in the roof, falling across the polygonal flower textures that cover the floor around the altar. Between the three fingers is a tome holding the spell “Heal.” Only one person can take and hold the spell.
</p>
<h5>The Three Fingers</h5>


<p>
Annwn bit off and spat out three, rebellious fingers that refused to listen. Each is named for an original Alpha Playtester who found and defeated Hafgan.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hawthorne</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Skeleton Queen, ruler of the icy wasteland. The skeletons and werewolves are hers and hers alone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alyx</strong>
</p>
<p>
Holder of the Horn of Dragoons, one of the Ideas. Without her, dragons would have stayed in their slumber.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Megalonia</strong>
</p>
<p>
The mother of all gLiches. Considered by the lore to be the most powerful magic user in .dungeon, holding the record for Most Spells Known by a single user.
</p>
<h4 id="room9">Room 9</h4>


<p>
A domed planetarium. Stars carved and painted into the ceiling twinkle in and out with holographic light. The beautiful voice chimes in, “Stand amid the stars and select the ones that grant you their skill.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> Select two skills your character is trained in. Remember, skills are flexible! They can all serve your purpose if you’re creative and curious.

<h4 id="room10">Room 10</h4>


<p>
A long hallway of black brick and tattered banners depicting a mighty dragon with an exposed heart, cracked and bleeding. A large ax swings at regular intervals, slashing through the air. To bypass it, make a skill check against the trap’s d12. <strong>Note:</strong> <em>Roll the d12 against each player separately.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> Encourage creativity with skill rolls. BUILD + Platforming is the default for trap-based challenges, but not every character will be built the same and not every player thinks the same. If someone has a different skill and can explain how they use it in a convincing way, allow it to be used instead.
</p>
<h4>Room 11</h4>


<p>
A square room of gray and red bricks, overgrown with kudzu and splayed hands of moss that wriggle at the sound of each footstep scoffing the stone floor. The door on the other side is reinforced with steel and has a large, steel lock. The UI prompts the players to use a lockpick or a key to open it and exit the dungeon.
</p>
<p>
The left wall has a large crack in it. It can be broken with a successful skill check or the use of a piece of gear. Beyond it is Room 12. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> <em>Environments can be interacted with and destroyed. Get creative to uncover the secrets of an area!</em>
</p>
<h4>Room 12</h4>


<p>
An identical square room of gray and red bricks, overgrown with kudzu and splayed hands of moss that wriggle at the sound of each footstep scoffing the stone floor. The wall which held the reinforced door in Room 11 is instead filled with the room’s normal brick texture. It’s an illusory wall that is dispelled when passed through.
</p>
<p>
The beautiful voice echoes from beyond the wall, “There may yet be secrets hidden in these ruins. Search carefully.”
</p>
<h4 id="room13">Room 13</h4>


<p>
A religious altar to Annwn, a beautiful mother-figure with sunflower hair and blooms of moss for eyes. In her outstretched hands lay five elaborate tarot cards. A large painting of her horrible death (she bites her fingers off as she tears the polyhedral organs from her body) towers behind her, stretching from floor to ceiling. 
</p>
<p>
The beautiful voice chimes in, “Approach me, heroes from another world. Choose the aspect of your world you wish to bring with you into this one. It is your advantage against the difficulty of this place.”
</p>
<h5>Aspects</h5>


<p>
The Blink Entertainment system reads you and your IRL surroundings while playing the game, allowing interactions between them. Choose the aspect tarot card that matches you for a unique interaction between you and the game. Each card has an upright and reversed side. The effects relate to <em>you</em>, the person playing the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alchemist</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can change a single word of a held item, changing its entire construction. Sword can become shield, for instance. Staff of Lightning can become Staff of Flying. After ten minutes, reverse this card. While reversed, the held item reverts to its original form.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beast</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright you can take the form of your pet, giving you an animal form. After ten minutes, reverse this card. While reversed, you cannot take animal form. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Berserker</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can enter a berserk mode on your turn and make an additional attack for each piercing you have. Then reverse this card. While reversed, you cannot use this ability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Knight</strong>
</p>
<p>
When you make a promise to an NPC, turn this upright. While upright you gain +2 to all rolls while acting for that promise. If the promise is broken, reverse this card. While reversed, you gain -2 to all rolls until the next session.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Magus</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can take on a physical trait from any tattoo on your body. After ten minutes, reverse this card. While reversed you cannot use this ability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Merchant</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can take a single item within reach into the virtual world. After doing so, reverse this card. While reversed, the item disappears after a single use or at the end of the session.
</p>
<h4 id="room14">Room 14</h4>


<p>
A cylindrical boss room, fitted with magnificent curtains torn by countless battles. Piles of half-formed avatars adorn the outer edges, many blades and arrows sticking out in decorative patterns. A chandelier swings unsteadily on a rusted chain up above, constantly dripping wax into misshapen lumps on the carpet. The boss is a plump goblin with the key to the door in Room 11. He commands his four goblin lackeys with barks and roars.

<p>
<strong>Rest Dice</strong>
</p>
<p>
Every time your Sync is reduced by 20, gain a Rest Dice. Rest Dice can only be spent at the end of a session, when you log out of the game. For each Rest Dice spent, roll d20 and regain that much Sync.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> Not every mob is defeated in one hit! When a stat block lists several dice (d8, d6, d6), that means the mob rolls the first dice until defeated, then it rolls the second until defeated, and finally the third. Always roll in the listed order!
</p>
<h3 id="the_eye">Tutorial Town</h3>


<p>
The first thing you see is the glow of the sun through the ruined church roof. Roll 2d6 to see what the sun looks like today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> Furious Crimson - Open wide, pupil miosis, harsh and sharp shadows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3-5.</strong> Confused Orange - Open wide, pupil dilated, long and blotchy shadows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6-8. </strong>Tired Purple - Three-quarters shut, wavering pupil, foggy and blurry shadows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>9-11.</strong> Melancholic Blue - Half shut, watery pupil, no shadows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>12.</strong> Asleep Navy - Fully shut, humming pupil, faint and dying shadows.
</p>
<h5>The Sun</h5>


<p>
If you open up .dungeon’s files, the texture used for the sun is called “the_eye.png.” It’s always visible in the sky, rotating on its axis. Pixelated and glowering. It waxes and wanes, opening and shutting depending on how the eye is feeling. This changes the virtual world’s global lighting, shifting it in density, brightness, and even hue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> <em>Roll 2d6 for the eye at the beginning of each session! Then roll a d10. On a 1 there’s an eclipse! See page (xx) for more info. </em>
</p>
<p>
The UI announces you are now in the Church of Annwn, Tutorial Town. Follow the travel rules, check out the marketplace to gear up, and make your way to the ferry when you’re ready to begin your journey!
</p>
<h4 id="travel">Travel Rules</h4>

<p>
<strong>Hexes</strong>
</p>
<p>
Annwn is broken up into hexes. To travel through a hex, a player must expend a resource or lose a Sync as their avatar becomes exhausted. Traveling through a hex forces a random encounter check and grants each traveler 1 Byte.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resources</strong>
</p>
<p>
Traveling into another hex costs 1 Resource per player. Characters who travel with no Resources lose 1 Sync.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bytes</strong>
</p>
<p>
Entering a hex for the first time that session gives each player 1 Byte. Bytes are the currency .dungeon is built around, allowing players to buy cool stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Random Encounters</strong>
</p>
<p>
Upon entering a hex, the Server checks for a random encounter by rolling 2d12. If the first dice is a 10-12 there’s a random encounter. The second dice determines what the random encounter is.
</p>

</p>
<h4 id="exploration">Exploration Rules</h4>

<p>
<strong>Assigning Difficulty</strong>
</p>
<p>
At times the Server may need to assign a difficulty to something.
</p>
<p>
D4 - Simple.
</p>
<p>
D6 - Easy.
</p>
<p>
D8 - Normal.
</p>
<p>
D10 - Hard.
</p>
<p>
D12 - Difficult.
</p>
<p>
D20 - Impossible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Climbing</strong>
</p>
<p>
Characters can only climb surfaces which are climbable. If the surface is deemed climbable by the Server, roll BUILD + Platforming against a difficulty they set.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Crafting</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you have the materials and skill training necessary to craft an item, roll HANDS + Crafting against a difficulty set by the Server. Lesser items are normal difficulty and greater items are hard difficulty. Failure means you waste the time and materials and end up with a “mysterious item,” which takes up an inventory slot.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Destructible Environments</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dealing damage to a non-hostile entity (like a door, an NPC, or a tree) means it’s destroyed. Some NPCs may be more sturdy, thanks to armor or magic, but that will be noted along with their information. Destroying a non-hostile entity means it's removed from the game and drops any loot it may have. For instance, when a tree is destroyed, it leaves behind Materials for crafting. If an entity is sufficiently large or resilient (like a wall), the Server can call for a contest and assign a difficulty.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Researching</strong>
</p>
<p>
What information are you searching for, and where are you searching for it? Roll META + Lore against a difficulty selected by the Server. The wiki is filled with fan-sourced articles about locations and entities in .dungeon. Some information can only be learned by saying the right thing to NPCs or talking with PUGS. If you succeed in your Research contest, gain a d4 to add to your next roll dealing the researched subject. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stealth</strong>
</p>
<p>
To be sneaky, roll PRESENCE + Sneak. The Server will either assign a difficulty, use a PUG’s stats or skills, or roll a monster’s dice as opposition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Swimming & Drowning</strong>
</p>
<p>
Swimming is difficult in Annwn. Roll BUILD + Strength against the Server’s D12. Failure means you are drowning. Mark a respawn each turn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Talking</strong>
</p>
<p>
Negotiating with NPCs is handled with a contest. Roll PRESENCE + Speech against a difficulty selected by the Server. Not every discussion with an NPC should require a dice roll. Only roll when convincing the NPC of something, negotiating with them or asking them to do something beyond their purview.
</p>
<p>
PUGs are not affected by the game’s dice rolls.
</p>
<h4 id="combat">Turn Based Combat</h4>
<p>
<strong>Initiative </strong>
</p>
<p>
Roll HANDS against the mob’s Initiative. You can always choose to delay your turn till the end of initiative.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rounds</strong>
</p>
<p>
Combat in .dungeon is turn-based. Each round lasts as long as it takes each player and mob to take their turn. A turn allows them to take an action and move.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you’re not in melee with a mob, you’re a Movement away from them. Ranged weapons can only be used a Movement away. Moving further means you’re fleeing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fleeing</strong>
</p>
<p>
After moving, roll PRESENCE against the mob. Fleeing from a PUG means evading them and hiding, but they might be persistent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Melee</strong>
</p>
<p>
Roll BUILD + Melee against the mob’s dice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ranged</strong>
</p>
<p>
Roll HANDS + Accuracy against the mob’s dice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aiming</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you use your action to aim, add d4 to your next ranged contest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Akimbo</strong>
</p>
<p>
To dual wield weapons you will need to explore Annwn for a Role that allows you to. When using two weapons, you can make two Contests per turn against the same or separate targets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you use your action to go on the defense, gain 1dr until your next turn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cover</strong>
</p>
<p>
If there is some form of cover, you can use your movement to take cover and gain 1dr from ranged attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Crit/Fumble</strong>
</p>
<p>
When two sides roll the same number in a contest, they roll again to break the tie. If the player wins, it’s a critical hit and they can take a second action. If the player loses, it’s a fumble and they lose twice as much Sync.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Prone</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you are knocked prone or are lying prone, monsters in melee with you deal +2 Sync damage and monsters at range do -2 Sync damage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Using Items</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can retrieve items from your bag on your turn and use them on that same turn. Retrieving and using the item is counted as an action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Morale</strong>
</p>
<p>
Monsters have to check their morale after half of their numbers are defeated. To do this, the Server rolls the Monster’s dice and adds them together. If it’s higher than the monsters’ morale stat, they stay and fight. Lower and they scatter or retreat. Retreating foes will return with a +1 Bonus next time they are encountered.
</p>
<h4 id="locations">Locations</h4>


<ol>

<li><strong>The Church of Annwn</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The stone walls no longer support the steepled roof. Sunlight glances in through great holes and busted windows. The church bell, which lies amid shattered pews, is etched with old screen names. <em>This is the respawn checkpoint for Tutorial Town.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Party Up</strong>
</p>
<p>
.dungeon supports a party system where at least 2 PCs can enter into a party, linking them. While in a party, you can communicate through comms, see markers over each other’s heads, and see each other’s status.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sidebar:</strong> After exiting the dungeon, all new players are given their starting gear: 3 bytes, 3 resources, and basic traveler’s clothes.
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Hafgan’s Guildhall</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hafgan’s banners burn. Brick walls crack and lean. A dragon rests on the crumpled roof, licking its fingers of the most recent newb-filled meal. Roll a d12 every thirty minutes. The dragon swoops from the guildhall to that numbered hex, breathing fire on everything below. To avoid being crisped, contest the dragon’s 3d6 (roll and add them together). The same contest must be made if approaching the guildhall while the dragon is present.

<strong>Number Appearing</strong> - The number next to a monster’s name is how many appear during each encounter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dice Notation </strong>- Bigger mobs are made up of multiple dice. 3d6 means rolling 3d6 and adding them together for a single contest. 3d6x4 means it rolls 3d6 until defeated in four contests before moving on to the other dice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Immune</strong> - Mobs that are immune to a certain damage type roll an extra d10 when contesting that damage type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Weak</strong> - If attacking a mob with something it's weak to, add d10 to your contest.

Inside: CrustWarrior cowers, waiting for a chance to escape the dragon. She started playing today and has been stuck here for fifteen minutes. The Happy Guild in Hex 6 sent her here as a prank. She’s embarrassed and doesn’t want you to know that she was duped so easily. There is nothing of value here.

<strong>CrustWarrior - PUG</strong>
</p>
<p>
Amanda Neals (she/her), 23, Grad Student. Her only goal at this moment is to get back at the Happy Guild and escape the island. If she can’t do it today she’ll probably stop playing altogether. If she parties up with you, she can add a d4 to a single roll per skill contest or combat round.

A large slab of stone, hastily chipped into a circle, aged and sunken into the mud and moss. Market stalls surround it, shattered into splinters. Fruit rots in the hands of dead NPCs. 
</p>
<p>
The only living NPC is Don McBon, and he’s trapped beneath his collapsed shop. He offers discounts to new players, but has nothing in his inventory to sell. He also touts the Gelatinous 6 (hex 4) as a great place to meet new players.

A blinking neon sign hangs catawampus from weathered chains on the side of a narrow townhouse. The sign reads “The Gelatinous 6, a place for new beginnings.”

<p>
Inside: the second floor has fallen into the first. Entities clip into each other and the environment. 2d6 glitchy Goblins with makeshift weapons are prepared for an ambush.

<p>
TomisGotAGun and BigJohnX07 are having a contest. They take turns rolling over the Ferryman’s body, causing it to ragdoll through the air, trying to get it the furthest. Whoever gets it in the water is a huge loser.
</p>
<p>
The ferry flies the banner of the Happy Guild and is under their control. They demand a price of 100 Bytes to use it. They will also trade passage for a party member’s life, or the neon sword in Grey Beards Cave (Hex 11).
</p>
<h5>The Happy Guild</h5>


<p>
Branded with the emoji smile, this guild is full of trolls and grifters. Organized only because it makes their trolling more efficient. Four members are stationed on Tutorial Island and they share 100 Sync between them. If their Sync reaches 0, they leave the island for good. If they are forced to respawn (due to taking a ton of damage, for instance), they respawn at their guildhouse, far away from Tutorial Island.
</p>
<p>
<strong>TomisGotAGun</strong>
</p>
<p>
Tomi (they/she), 19, film major. She loves lying about a powerful spell in Hafgan’s Hall (hex 2). She’s always high while logged on and likes to talk about obscure Korean horror films, to the dismay of her guildies.

<ol>

<li><strong>Mausoleum of Abandoned Accounts</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A graveyard shaded by massive swords stabbing down into the ground. Moss creeps on every surface and the weathered tombstones no longer remember the names of those buried below.
</p>

In the center is a statue of Annwn as she tears fingers from her hand. An engraving lists the number of abandoned accounts (12,340), active accounts (174), and total deaths on the server (876,456).
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Ghost Watch</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A clocktower, partially collapsed. Bricks spill in from the roof onto the remains of the hour hand, stabbed into the floor. Books that were once filled with spells are scorched, ransacked, and torn to shreds. Pinned to the ground by the minute hand is the Loremaster, an NPC who dishes out beginner quests to those not ready to leave the island. He has information on every hex and doesn’t notice that he’s trapped.
</p>
<p>
	If freed, he will travel with the players until they find another settlement. As long as he is in the party, all Lore rolls get +1.
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Mushroom Village</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Tiny cottages dug into the hills. Barrows drilled into the stems of mighty mushrooms. The wreckage of many draconic strafes. The friendly fungalfolk still reside here, though their numbers are thinner. Some are glitched in the ruins of homes. Others cower permanently in fear of the dragon. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tinnitus</strong> - A buff red-topped mushroom with a mighty blade and dreams of slaying the dragon. Will ride on a player’s back for 5 Bytes. While traveling with a player, they add +2 to Melee rolls. Refuses to leave Tutorial Island unless the dragon is taken care of.
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Ancient Well</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A garden overgrown with wildflowers. They sing a different solemn tune depending on the shade of the sun. The ruins of gargoyle warriors lie scattered across the topiary. At the center, a large overturned stone slab reveals a rusted ladder down into a forgotten well.
</p>
<ul>

<li>The bottom of the well drips with old water that etches small streams in the rocky floor. A discarded shield barricades the door on the left.

<li>2 Shadow Skeletons spit glitched curses at all who enter their domain.

<h3 id="avatar">Avatar</h3>


<p>
Use the variety of sliders to adjust aspects of your avatar’s appearance, including color, hair, eyes, limbs, and body type. Since .dungeon was created in the late 90’s, its aesthetics have stayed there and in the early-2000’s. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aesthetic</strong>
</p>
<p>
The .dungeon aesthetic is very early-2000’s. Lots of hoodies, trucker hats, low-rise and lace-up jeans, bedazzled jackets, popcorn shirts, choker necklaces, halter tops, pants that say “juicy” on the butt, too much denim, too many studded belts, baby tees, dual-coloured rugby shirts, frosted and glittery accessories, double layer formal dresses, and gothic color palettes.
</p>
<p>
	Inside the small community for the game, there’s a large number of folks who enjoy doing “.fashion,” where the point is to make your avatar the most glam, the most fabulous, and the most badass they can possibly be. Share images of your decked out avatar on the message boards and join in on the discussions!
</p>
<h4>Screen Name</h4>


<p>
Your IRL name is cool and all, but this is the virtual world, so you need to choose a screen name. Username. Whatever you want to call it.
</p>
<h4 id="job">Job</h4>


<p>
We bring ourselves into the game and our past experiences aid our digital adventuring. Choose a <strong>trained skill </strong>to begin the game with.
</p>
<h4 id="stats">Stats</h4>


<p>
You bring four stats with you into the virtual world. These are your real-world traits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Build </strong>- system mastery, character optimization, the crunch of the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meta </strong>- knowledge of the game, its setting, and its development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Presence </strong>- your senses, charisma, and general connection to the virtual world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hands </strong>- your reaction time, hand/eye coordination, and precision.
</p>
<p>
Assign a different die from the standard set of polyhedral dice to your stats: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. The larger the die, the better you are in that stat.
</p>
<h5>Tilt</h5>


<p>
How you keep your cool when the virtual world is unfair. Other RPGs call this a “save” or a “saving throw.” Whenever your character takes on a status effect, springs a trap, or has to avoid an environmental obstacle, roll your Tilt die. Getting a 4 or over is a success, removing the status, avoiding the trap, or escaping the obstacle. 
</p>
<h5>Respawns</h5>


<p>
Whenever you fail a Contest, you can mark a respawn, choosing to let it kill your avatar. This avoids any Sync damage, removes any statuses your avatar has, and respawns you back at the nearest checkpoint, taking you out of the encounter. You’ll return to your Party at the end of the encounter. Everyone starts with 3 respawns. 
</p>
<h5>RNG</h5>


<p>
Also known as “luck” in other RPGs, RNG rolls are done for random events, loot drops, and other acts of chance the Server needs to account for. You might roll RNG against an NPC to see if they are nearby, or to determine who is targeted by the dragon’s fire attack.
</p>
<h4 id="role">Role</h4>


<p>
Your role grants you an in-game ability or bonus. Additional roles can be found and unlocked by exploring the world. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>DPS</strong>
</p>
<p>
All combat rolls count as +1. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tank</strong>
</p>
<p>
Once per encounter you can reduce incoming Sync damage to you or a party member by d6. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Support</strong>
</p>
<p>
All healing you do or take counts as +2. This counts for items or magical effects.
</p>
<h4 id="aspect">Aspect</h4>


<p>
The Blink Entertainment system reads you and your surroundings while playing, allowing interactions between them. Aspects are your unique way of interacting between them and are represented by tarot cards. Each has an upright and reversed side. The effects relate to <em>you</em>, the person playing the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Knight</strong>
</p>
<p>
When you make a promise to an NPC, turn this upright. While upright you gain +2 to all rolls while acting for that promise. If the promise is broken, reverse this card. While reversed, you gain a -2 to all rolls until the next session.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beast</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright you can take the form of your pet, giving you an animal form. After ten minutes, reverse this card. While reversed, you cannot take animal form. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Berserker</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can enter a berserk mode and can make an additional attack for each piercing you have. Then reverse this card. While reversed you cannot use this ability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Magus</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can take on a physical trait from any tattoo on your body. After ten minutes, reverse this card. While reversed you cannot use this ability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Merchant</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can take a single item within reach of you into the virtual world. After doing so, reverse this card. While reversed, the item disappears after a single use or at the end of the session.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alchemist</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn this card upright at the beginning of each day. While this card is upright, you can change a single word of a held item, changing its entire construction. Sword can become shield, for instance. Staff of Lightning can become Staff of Flying. After ten minutes, reverse this card. While reversed, the held item reverts to its original form.
</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>


<p>
Skills are in-game abilities that dictate how good your Avatar is at accomplishing tasks. Choose three skills to gain training in, alongside the one skill gifted by your Job. <strong>Training </strong>in a skill means you get +2 to rolls when using it. <strong>Expertise </strong>in a skill means you get +4 to rolls when using it.
</p>
<p>
Skills are categorized by which Stat they fall under. Add your bonus to Contests where the Skill is applicable, rolling your Stat Dice and adding the Skill to the result.
</p>
<h4>Skill Training</h4>


<p>
To learn a new skill, PCs must find someone who can teach it to them. This requires a payment of 20 Bytes and a week of downtime. To gain Expertise in a skill, the player and the Server Host must agree to a challenge. Failure to accomplish the challenge locks you out of the skill until another challenge is agreed upon. If the challenge is accomplished, the player gains Expertise in the skill.
</p>
<h5>Build</h5>


<p>
<strong>Defense</strong>
</p>
<p>
Instead of armor, characters have a base defense that acts as damage reduction. Training in defense gives you 1dr, and Expertise gives you 2dr. Some clothes and armor may offer more damage reduction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Magic</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in magic lets you cast spells. Without training, you might be able to read the spells but their magic is lost to you. Expertise allows you to identify who cast a particular spell and detect magic in the area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Melee</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in melee allows you to use big melee weapons. Expertise allows you a unique “stance” with your weapon of choice. Whether you’re swinging a sword or punch, add your training when making attacks against opponents. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Platforming</strong>
</p>
<p>
Acrobatic leaps, climbing, and navigating dangerous terrain. Training in platforming gives you tighter control over your Avatar’s movements. Expertise gives you a double jump.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Strength</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knocking things over, pushing things out of the way, and general, hand-made destruction. Training in strength makes objects weigh less to your character. Expertise lets you throw large objects.
</p>
<h5>Meta</h5>


<p>
<strong>Alchemy</strong>
</p>
<p>
Creating and identifying foils. Training in alchemy allows your character to craft lesser foils out of materials. Expertise lets you craft greater foils.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arcanum</strong>
</p>
<p>
The knowledge of and training to use magic items and sci-fi tech. Training in arcanum allows you to use neon weapons. Expertise gives you basic information about magic items that are within your line of sight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dreams</strong>
</p>
<p>
Considered a hidden skill of the game, because it is not clearly defined on the wiki. Training in dreams allows you to make pacts with the pantheon of .dungeon. Expertise in it allows you to open yourself to the world of Annwn and receive messages from it. Often cryptic or prophetic. [Call to action! The .dungeon wiki is open for new contributors who know more about this skill.]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lore</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in lore means the game expands descriptive text. Expertise means the game might butt in to give you information, even when you didn’t ask for it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Navigation</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in navigation improves your HUD radar and quest markers. Expertise gives you active hints to help you search and travel.
</p>
<h5>Presence</h5>


<p>
<strong>Animal Handling</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in animal handling allows you to take on animals (and some monsters) as pets. Expertise in animal handling lets you reroll animal reactions to you, and take on a mount.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Perception</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in perception improves colors, sounds, and smells to enhance your senses. Expertise in perception does this even more and also adds faint outlines to things of interest. The invisible hands of the game like you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sneak</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in sneak reduces the ambient and active sounds of your Avatar. Expertise makes it completely silent while crouched.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Speech</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in speech improves NPC reactions to you. Expertise in speech rerolls reaction rolls, even in dangerous situations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Vibes</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in vibes improves the haptic feedback of your VR rig, giving you subtle signals when things are off. Expertise improves this even more and makes NPCs more readable.
</p>
<h5>Hands</h5>


<p>
<strong>Accuracy</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in accuracy reduces arrow and bullet drop and other things that affect the trajectory of ranged attacks. Expertise subtly slows aiming down to give you greater control.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Crafting</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in crafting allows you to create lesser versions of items as long as you have the supplies. Expertise allows you to create greater versions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Engineering</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in engineering aids you in repairing vehicles and other machinery in the world. Expertise aids you further by reducing repair costs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Explosives</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in explosives allows you more wiggle room for failure while using them in combat, and aids you in the building/disarming of explosives. Expertise allows you to disarm explosives without destroying them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Piloting</strong>
</p>
<p>
Training in pilot improves vehicle responsiveness and makes them easier to control. Expertise allows for a semi-auto-pilot so you can take on simple tasks while also piloting.

<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>


<p>
There are four tiers of gear: simple, greater, rare, and legendary. Most of the gear you can buy in .dungeon is greater or simple. These two tiers are also craftable by players and NPCs using the in-game crafting system. Most gear aids players in contests, giving them bonuses to certain rolls or allowing them to forgo rolling at all (no need to roll to climb a mountain if you have climbing gear). 
</p>
<p>
	Rare items include magical items, most foils, and unique pieces of gear. These items can only be crafted by specialized NPCs found sporadically throughout Annwn. Legendary gear are the most powerful items in the game, often using the haptic feedback of VR to create bleed between reality and the virtual world. These items were created by the developers of the game and are typically hidden behind dangerous dungeons, multi-faceted quests, or difficult challenges.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rare NPCs</strong>
</p>
<p>
The NPCs who create rare items are coveted by .dungeon’s players. In particular, the Diamond Dogs guild have made it their duty to protect certain NPCs because if an NPC dies, whether by troll or freak accident, them and their unique items are gone forever. 
</p>
<h3 id="RAM">Ram</h3>


<p>
Each character starts with a backpack that has ten inventory slots. Anything more needs to be put into storage or it sits on the ground as a little rotating sprite of a bag. Anyone can pick up items that have dropped like this. Each storage slot costs 1 Byte per week and can be accessed at any storage chest (found within settlements). 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Naked</strong>
</p>
<p>
Speedrunners and PUGs know that stripping all armor and clothes off a character so they’re a naked mass of polygons gives +2 to platforming and initiative rolls. But they also know all incoming damage is increased by +2 as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Starting Gear</strong>
</p>
<p>
Every new avatar starts with 3 Bytes, a knife, and basic traveler clothes.
</p>
<h3 id="bytes">Bytes Currency</h3>


<p>
Bytes are the currency of .dungeon. They can only be gained by interacting with the game: traveling to far away places, fighting mobs, exploring randomly generated structures, and taking on quests. They are used for everything from buying gear, to casting spells, and uncovering secrets in the world.
</p>
<h4>Gaining Bytes</h4>


<p>
A character will gain 1 byte (1b) per day as long as they log in and play for that day. Traveling into a new hex for the first time that session will gain the character 1b. Defeating a combat encounter without taking Sync damage will gain the party an additional 1b each.
</p>
<h4>The Hidden World of Bytes</h4>


<p>
Last year, players discovered that an entire region of the map was unlocked once they accumulated enough bytes, leading others to speculate that the developers have hidden other things behind the Bytes Currency. Secret doors have been found in the tutorial dungeon. Some mobs are hidden until a certain number of bytes are acquired. There are many secrets we’ve yet to uncover!

</p>
<p>
<strong>Pocket Annwn Lovebook</strong>

Annwn had many lovers as she was a very loving (if sad) god. This little book is held right over one’s heart in a chest pocket. It can be sacrificed to negate the Sync damage from one Gun attack.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Instrument</strong>
</p>
<p>
Guitars, keyboards, synths, drums, and all other instruments. Each avatar starts with the ability to play one of the OST’s twelve hidden songs, and everyone can learn them by watching another player perform them.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Ladder</strong>

A 20’ ladder that can be used to climb, bridge gaps, or platform without a dice roll.

</p>
<h3 id="foils">Foils</h3>


<p>
There’s a sect of players obsessed with .dungeon’s pseudo-collectible card game. Card packs have a small chance of containing Foils, holographic cards that act as one-use magic items in place of potions and other consumables. The game’s true card-heads believe there’s a connection between Aspect cards and the collectible card game.

<h3 id="pets">Pets</h3>


<p>

<h4>Upkeep</h4>


<p>
Players who purchase a vehicle need to pay its upkeep cost once each session it is used. This covers fuel and general maintenance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Skateboard/Rollerblades</strong>
</p>
<p>
Besides doing sick tricks and stunts, these vehicles allow you to move twice as far during combat encounters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Glider</strong>
</p>
<p>
The glider is the biggest transport that can be kept in your inventory. It allows you to fall from great heights and cross into an adjacent hex without taking a random encounter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wingsuit</strong>
</p>
<p>
When purchased, your clothes and armor are altered to fit the wingsuit. It grants the same benefits as a glider while also letting you perform airborne stunts in combat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Horse</strong>
</p>
<p>
A beautiful horse of a random breed. Enjoys carrots and horseplay. Can carry 5 additional inventory slots.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Giant Lizard</strong>
</p>
<p>
A big, colorful lizard of a random breed. Enjoys eating big bugs and prefers desert terrain. Allows you to climb even unclimbable mountains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spider Envoy</strong>
</p>
<p>
Eight-legged princesses of Luna, the spider queen. These envoys are found in forest terrain and enjoy scritches. Can carry two players at once.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tamed Dreg</strong>
</p>
<p>
Raptor-like creatures covered in multicolored feathers, which use their large beaks to break their prey. They are the fastest creatures in .dungeon, reducing random encounter checks to every 2nd hex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>87 Chevalier Antelope</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two-door, matte colors. 10 extra storage slots. Travel freely across Annwn as long as you can afford the upkeep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Toy Troll AE86</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two-door, silver and black, speedster. Travel freely across Annwn as long as you can afford the upkeep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Python SR1</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two-door sports car, gloss colors. Travel freely across Annwn as long as you can afford the upkeep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lamb Martini Miura</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two-door sports car, gloss colors. Travel freely across Annwn as long as you can afford the upkeep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>91 Fjord Adventurer</strong>
</p>
<p>
Four-door SUV, bland colors. 15 extra storage slots. Travel freely across Annwn as long as you can afford the upkeep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sublue Sandbar</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two-door flatbed pickup, white. 25 extra storage slots. Travel freely across Annwn as long as you can afford the upkeep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>UW Scarab</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two-door round car, yellow. 5 extra storage slots. Travel freely across Annwn as long as you can afford the upkeep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Train</strong>
</p>
<p>
Various train tracks criss-cross Annwn’s surface and underground. One ticket buys you near-instant transport between any two connected settlements. Buying a train means building your own track between two settlements. After construction, you receive an extra 2 Bytes every time you log on, from people using the track.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Teleportation Circle</strong>
</p>
<p>
Large circle of marble and granite, carved with intricate hand signs which facilitate magical transportation. Unlike trains, all teleportation circles are linked to each other. As long as they are both powered, you can use one to travel any distance to any other teleportation circle.
</p>
<p>
	Buying a circle means buying an unused or unpowered one, or building a new one within a new settlement or guildhall. These do not get you any extra Bytes, but they help to interconnect Annwn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Simple Airship</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two to four seats. 10 storage slots. Can travel freely over the server with no risk of random encounters. Buying one trip means paying an NPC or Player Character to pick you up and take you to a destination. The price does not include a ride back. Buying your own simple airship means you get to design it. Upkeep includes storing it in a settlement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Greater Aiship</strong>
</p>
<p>
Larger, commercial vessels. 50 storage slots. Buying one trip means getting a ticket between two settlements. The flight lasts ten minutes of game time and allows for the guests to mingle. Certain NPCs only spawn on airships, including unique merchants.
</p>
<p>
	Buying your own greater airship means you get to design it. Upkeep includes storing it in a settlement.

<h4>Upkeep</h4>


<p>
A building’s upkeep cost is only required if you built or own the structure. It measures the number of resources needed to keep the building up and running every IRL month.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal Room</strong>
</p>
<p>
A room with a single bed in another existing structure. Buying one gives you a place to decorate, and on your birthday all the NPCs you’re friendly with will show up for a birthday party.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Job Board</strong>
</p>
<p>
A small structure that sits in the center of town. Players and NPCs can post jobs which draw even more NPCs and players to the town.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense Tower</strong>
</p>
<p>
A small structure that sits on the outer edge of a settlement, granting all its NPCs +1 defense. Building one spawns a ranger NPC who collects supplies and resources for the settlement. No settlement can have more than four defense towers.
</p>
<p>
	If all four are built, construction on a ranger guild house begins immediately, and finishes after [time]. This grants a low percentage chance for ranger allies to arrive and assist the settlement. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lesser House</strong>
</p>
<p>
A modest house with 1-2 rooms. Buying one gives you a place to decorate. Building one will spawn a random NPC to live in it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arena</strong>
</p>
<p>
A large structure with a performance area and seating for 50. Building one spawns three soldier NPCs who have an intense rivalry and will fight every Friday night.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Guildhall</strong>
</p>
<p>
A small structure for a guild to decorate and call their own. Includes 20 slots of shared storage, a shared bank where members can store their Bytes, and a Respawn Anchor which, when active, allows all members to respawn at it instead of the nearest settlement. The Respawn Anchor can be moved by the Guild Leader.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Market</strong>
</p>
<p>
A large structure that connects the settlement to the server Auction House, allowing trades to be made over long distances. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Greater House</strong>
</p>
<p>
Larger house with 2-4 rooms. Buying one gives you a place to decorate and a place for your party members to live. Building one will spawn two random NPCs to live in it, with a chance of them falling in love and making more NPCs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inn</strong>
</p>
<p>
Larger house with 4 small rooms upstairs and a serving area downstairs. Buying one gives you an additional 3 Bytes each day you log on. Building one spawns an Innkeeper NPC and allows traveling NPCs to stop by.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tavern</strong>
</p>
<p>
Smaller house with one large serving area. Buying one gives you an additional 3 Bytes each day you log on. Building one spawns a bartender and a chef NPC and allows traveling NPCs to arrive. This also creates a space for NPCs to mingle and possibly start relationships, which can grow the settlement.

<strong>Adventure Companion</strong>
</p>
<p>
These PUGs hire themselves out to go on adventures with other online players. They grant a +2 to dice rolls they can help with. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Text Message Partner</strong>
</p>
<p>
These PUGs offer company to folks who want someone to talk to. Texting with them grants you a +1 to all Presence rolls for the day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kinky Dungeon Friend</strong>
</p>
<p>
These sex workers are PUGs with high-level avatars who offer a unique experience. It’s part dungeon crawl assistance and part kinky fun. It’s not for everyone, but .dungeon devs haven’t shied away from creating a safe space for sex workers to offer their brand of entertainment. They grant a +2 to all rolls.
</p>
<h3 id="legendary_items">Legendary Items</h3>


<p>
These are unique and powerful items that often bleed irl into the virtual world. They are found in the most dangerous dungeons, at the end of long and complicated quest chains, or as rewards for hidden world events.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Arawn’s Mirror</strong>
</p>
<p>
A glass hand-mirror with thin veins of blood pumping around the frame in off-beat rhythms. The holder can gaze into the mirror to create a duplicate of themself. The holder can control the duplicate while staring into the mirror, which shows what the duplicate can see. When not looking into the mirror, the duplicate acts of its own volition as any other NPC might.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Black Rose</strong>
</p>
<p>
A handcannon of black metal and gold that shoots blooming, ruby bullets. Every attack with a rose bullet adds +d6 to the contest. The Black Rose starts with a rose bullet for every flower/plant in the player’s irl playing area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dog Whistle</strong>
</p>
<p>
A bone whistle carved with a hundred, snarling, hound fangs. When blown, a war dog is summoned in-game for every dog in your irl house.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nirvana</strong>
</p>
<p>
A glorious staff topped with a golden phoenix, once held by Hafgan himself. Once per session you can spread the phoenix’s wings, causing all party members’ attacks to do +3 solar damage for the encounter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scapegoat</strong>
</p>
<p>
A cute, fluffy sheep doll that rests neatly on any backpack. Always smiling. You can put any number of Bytes into it each day. The scapegoat can negate an amount of damage equal to the Bytes put into it. Each point of damage removes a Byte. When it runs out of Bytes, it frowns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Team Special</strong>
</p>
<p>
A baseball bat of twisted wood, branded as an “Annwn Slugger.” Functions as a simple weapon. Once per encounter, you can perform a combo attack with another party member, adding both of your attack rolls together to make one, combined Contest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Horn of Dragoon</strong>
</p>
<p>
Carved from the tooth of Annwn. This spiral horn, with its three separate openings, charms all dragons who hear it. While charmed they will do as commanded, but they do not do it kindly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Ring of Melancholy</strong>
</p>
<p>
A one of a kind ring, carved from the sadness of Annwn. Once per day, the wearer can tell a sad story which inflicts a special condition called “Sadness” to all within earshot. Sadness makes their avatar cry uncontrollably for 10 minutes, leaving them motionless.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tome of Dreams</strong>
</p>
<p>
The obsidian-bound text that acted as the foundation of the Abrellian Academy. When opened, all entities in the vicinity, excluding the opener, fall asleep and must fight their “inner demon” in a liminal dream space to wake up.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Winter Cloak</strong>
</p>
<p>
A cloak of white fog and ice that blows with its own wind. During the winter months, the wearer can cross any source of water, as their footsteps freeze and leave behind small lilypads of ice. 
</p>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>


<p>
The game’s current patch uses shadow magic, a magical art created by Annwn herself. By combining Bytes with hand signs that either do or don’t cast a shadow, you can create strange and sometimes helpful effects. Spells are discovered on scrolls, inside of tomes, and carved on dungeon walls. There is no centralized school of magic or a way to begin the game as a spellcaster anymore.
</p>
<h3 id="learn">Learning Spells</h3>


<p>
To learn these spells you must find a scroll, book, or carving that demonstrates the hand signs. Some PUGs are kind enough to pass on spells they’ve learned to others, but they have to be demonstrated in-game. Following a diagram on the wiki can teach you the hand signs, but your character won’t know the spell until they study it or are taught it. PUGs usually charge upwards of 50 Bytes to teach you one of their spells.
</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>


<p>
.dungeon’s options menu lets players toggle off spellcasting’s extensive hand movements. Some players prefer voice commands or the spellcasting menu where you simply use buttons to input the proper hand signs in the correct order.
</p>
<h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>


<p>
<strong>Target</strong> - Any single entity, player character, or PUG that is on the field of battle, including the caster.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Caster</strong> - The entity casting the spell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Field of Battle</strong> - Everything considered to be in combat at the time, in melee and range. If something is nearby but not present in the combat, it is not considered to be “in the field of battle.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Auto-Destroy</strong> - Removes the target’s current dice without a contest roll. If a mob is made of more than one dice, only the current dice is destroyed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Area</strong> - All entities and space that is within melee range of the target.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Interrupt</strong> - Magic that can be cast out of turn order. Using a spell to interrupt costs 3 extra Bytes and counts as your next up-coming turn. If the spell cancels an action that is being performed, or changes the conditions for whoever’s turn it is, that person gains another movement to use immediately.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Skill</strong> - If a spell calls for a dice roll, use the listed Skill.

<h3>How to Play</h3>


<p>
.dungeon uses a standard set of polyhedral dice which are assigned to your stats during character creation. When you come into conflict with the world, you and the Server will roll the appropriate dice to see how you fare. This is called a Contest. Sometimes you’ll win and sometimes you’ll lose. Losing a contest means your opponent either performs a stunt or “deals damage” to you, reducing your group’s Sync and bringing you closer to the end of your journey in Annwn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Contests</strong>
</p>
<p>
Any dice roll the players make is compared to either the Server’s dice roll or a set difficulty. Before and after the roll, ask yourself questions like these as needed: Why is the contest being called? What is the intended outcome? What are the possible pitfalls?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Teamwork</strong>
</p>
<p>
Two players can roll their dice for the same task and take the higher of the two. Monsters and PUGs can do the same.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Failure</strong>
</p>
<p>
When you lose a contest, things don’t go your way. Sometimes this means utter failure, other times it means things mostly work out but it takes longer than hoped or some other complication.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Damage</strong>
</p>
<p>
When you fail a contest in combat, you subtract the dice’s difference from the group’s Sync. This is called “taking damage.” 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stunts</strong>
</p>
<p>
Winning a contest can do more than deal damage. You can do anything that a character in a video game could do. Stunts include haggling for prices, gathering secret information, cutting down a tree, swinging from a chandelier, or disarming an opponent. Mobs and PUGs can perform stunts as well, so watch out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sync</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your connection to the game and the other players at the table. The game will end someday. It is inevitable. Boredom or burnout sets in. People move on. Circumstances change. Sync is measured with a d100 which is set to 100 at character creation. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rest or Return</strong>
</p>
<p>
The first time you hit any threshold on the Sync chart below, you gain a rest dice. If the threshold indicates “Rest and Return,” you gain a rest dice <em>every </em>time you fall below that threshold, otherwise you only gain it when you first pass it. Sync cannot go above 100.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sync Chart</strong>
</p>
<p>
100 - Rest and Return
</p>
<p>
80 - Rest
</p>
<p>
60 - Rest and Return
</p>
<p>
40 - Rest
</p>
<p>
20 - Rest and Return
</p>
<p>
0 - Game Over
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rest Dice</strong>
</p>
<p>
Gained when passing a threshold. To spend one, roll d20 at the end of the session, when you log out, and regain that much Sync.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Respawns</strong>
</p>
<p>
When returning to a “rest and return” threshold, unmark all respawns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Game Over</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Sync reaches 0, it’s “Game Over.” It's the end of summer and you’ve gotta focus on school. Your server is closing down. You’re drifting apart. Talk about the reason. Put the manual away and tell the stories of what happened here. 
</p>
<h3 id="travel2">Travel Rules</h3>


<p>
All travel is hex-based. Traveling into another hex costs 1 Resource per player. Characters who travel with no Resources lose 1 Sync per hex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bytes</strong>
</p>
<p>
Entering a hex for the first time that session gives each player 1 Byte. Bytes are the currency .dungeon is built around, allowing players to buy cool stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Random Encounters</strong>
</p>
<p>
Upon entering a hex, the Server checks for a random encounter by rolling 2d12. If the first dice is a 10-12 there’s a random encounter. The second dice determines what the random encounter is. Random Encounter charts are found in the bestiary.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reaction Rolls</strong>
</p>
<p>
When running into an entity whose reaction is uncertain, roll their dice to determine their reaction.
</p>
<p>
<em>Dice - Reaction</em>
</p>
<p>
1-2. Immediately violent
</p>
<p>
3-8. Cautious and avoidant
</p>
<p>
9-14. Indifferent
</p>
<p>
15-19. Cautious but curious
</p>
<p>
20+. Friendly
</p>
<h3 id="exploration2">Exploration Rules</h3>


<p>
<strong>Checking in with Friends</strong>
</p>
<p>
There is no dice roll to talk with other players within .dungeon, either those in your party or PUGs who are online. If a dice roll comes up during a conversation, that’s alright, but other players within .dungeon are not affected by your stats or compelled to act a certain way because you roll high on your Presence check.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Climbing</strong>
</p>
<p>
Characters can only climb surfaces which are climbable. If the surface is deemed climbable by the Server, roll BUILD + Platforming against a difficulty they set.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Crafting</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you have the materials and skill training necessary to craft an item, roll HANDS + Crafting against a difficulty set by the Server. Lesser items are normal difficulty and greater items are hard difficulty. Failure means you waste the time and materials and end up with a “mysterious item,” which takes up an inventory slot (and may become useful in a future supplement).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Destructible Environments</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dealing damage to a non-hostile entity (like a door, an NPC, or a tree) means it’s destroyed. Some NPCs may be more sturdy, thanks to armor or magic, but that will be noted along with their information. Destroying a non-hostile entity means it's removed from the game and drops any loot it may have. For instance, when a tree is destroyed, it leaves behind Materials for crafting. If an entity is sufficiently large or resilient (like a wall), the Server can call for a contest and assign a difficulty.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Digital Companionship</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can buy or offer the services of digital companionship during downtime. This includes everything from messaging a solo player to explicit activities. The .dungeon team have never shied away from sex workers using their game as a platform. And while there are moderations limiting advertisements to certain spaces, there are people offering everything from kinky friendship to nude video chats within in-game brothels and private practices in Annwn. There’s a bustling ecology of people who will help you adventure, grind, and pass the time for a few Bytes (see Kinky Dungeon Friends, pg xx).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fishing</strong>
</p>
<p>
A fishing rod and a body of water are required to fish. After casting your line, roll RNG + Navigation, Animal Handling, or Vibes and compare with the chart below.
</p>
<p>
<em>You pull up…</em>
</p>
<p>
1-4. Useless junk. Gain 1 Material.
</p>
<p>
4-8. Common fish. Gain 1 Resource.
</p>
<p>
9-12. Small chest. Gain d6 Bytes.
</p>
<p>
13-19. Rare fish! Gain 1 Fashion Material.
</p>
<p>
20+. Legendary fish! Roll initiative.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Grinding</strong>
</p>
<p>
To grind, you need the proper equipment (resources, mags, weapons), at least a day of downtime, and the information (who drops the item and where they spawn). If those criteria are met, roll an RNG contest against each of the mob’s dice. Success means you get the drop you wanted, failure means you waste a day’s worth of resources. If you succeed, you can also forgo the drop in exchange for an d4 bonus to your next RNG roll. Players do this to aid in finding rare drops during play.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Researching</strong>
</p>
<p>
What information are you searching for, and where are you searching for it? Roll META + Lore against a difficulty selected by the Server. The wiki is filled with fan-sourced articles about locations and entities in .dungeon. Some information can only be learned by saying the right thing to NPCs or talking with PUGS. If you succeed in your Research contest, gain a d4 to add to your next roll dealing the researched subject.
</p>
<p>

If an item is listed on the gear list and you have the Bytes to buy it, you can. This can be done any time outside of a session. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stealth</strong>
</p>
<p>
To be sneaky, roll PRESENCE + Sneak. The Server will either assign a difficulty, use a PUG’s stats or skills, or roll a monster’s dice as opposition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Swimming & Drowning</strong>
</p>
<p>
Swimming is difficult in Annwn. Roll BUILD + Strength against the Server’s D12. Failure means you are drowning. Mark a respawn each turn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Talking</strong>
</p>
<p>
Negotiating with NPCs is handled with a contest. Roll PRESENCE + Speech against a difficulty selected by the Server. Not every discussion with an NPC should require a dice roll. Only roll when convincing the NPC of something, negotiating with them or asking them to do something beyond their purview.
</p>
<p>
PUGs are not affected by the game’s dice rolls.
</p>
<h4>Turn Based Combat</h4>


<p>
[I’m seeing this as a page with a simple battle grid, like old-school final fantasy. This is where we’d put the full combat rules.]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Initiative </strong>
</p>
<p>
Roll HANDS against the mob’s Initiative. Delay your turn to go last.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rounds</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turn based rpg. Each player and mob can make a movement and take an action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you’re not in melee with a mob, you’re a Movement away from them. Ranged weapons can only be used a Movement away. Moving further means you’re fleeing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fleeing</strong>
</p>
<p>
Move and roll PRESENCE against the mob. Fleeing from a PUG means evading them and hiding, but they might be persistent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Melee </strong>
</p>
<p>
Roll BUILD + Melee against the mob’s dice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ranged</strong>
</p>
<p>
Roll HANDS + Accuracy against the mob’s dice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aiming</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you use your action to aim, then add d4 to your next ranged contest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Akimbo</strong>
</p>
<p>
To dual wield weapons you will need to explore Annwn for a Role that allows you to. When using two weapons, you can make two Contests per turn against the same or separate targets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you use your action to go on the defensive, then you gain 1dr until your next turn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cover</strong>
</p>
<p>
If there is some form of cover, you can use your movement to take cover and gain 1dr from ranged attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Crit/Fumble</strong>
</p>
<p>
When two sides roll the same number in a contest, they roll again to break the tie. If the player wins, it’s a critical hit and they can take a second action. If they player loses, it’s a fumble and they lose twice as much Sync.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Prone</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you are knocked prone or are lying prone, monsters in melee with you deal +2 Sync damage and monsters at range do -2 Sync damage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Using Items</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can retrieve items from your bag on your turn and use them on that same turn. Retrieving and using the item is counted as an action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Morale</strong>
</p>
<p>
Monsters have to check their morale after half of their numbers are defeated. To do this, the Server rolls the Monsters’ dice and adds them together. If it’s higher than the monsters’ morale stat, they stay and fight. Lower and they scatter/retreat. Retreating foes will return as +1 next time they are encountered.
</p>
<h3 id="status">Statuses</h3>


<p>
Statuses are applied when traps are triggered, mobs land unique attacks, or by fumbling certain actions. When a status is applied, its effects are immediate. A player can use their action to make a Tilt roll to end the status. Otherwise they’ll need foils or magic to cure the status.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bleeding</strong>
</p>
<p>
Take 1 Sync damage at the start of each of your turns until the bleeding is stopped.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Blinded</strong>
</p>
<p>
All navigation or targeting requires a successful Luck roll. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Burning</strong>
</p>
<p>
Take d6 Sync damage at the start of your turn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Charmed</strong>
</p>
<p>
Act on the charmer’s turn and add your dice to their damage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Confused</strong>
</p>
<p>
All rolls that don’t succeed are considered fumbles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Deafened</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can’t hear any voice communications or game sounds. You may need to cover your ears, leave the room, or deafen your headset.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Drowning</strong>
</p>
<p>
You’ve failed your swimming roll and are now drowning. Roll Tilt at the start of your turn until someone saves you or you are forced to respawn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frightened</strong>
</p>
<p>
You must use your turn to move as far away from the thing that frightened you. You can’t take actions that harm the thing that frightened you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Grappled</strong>
</p>
<p>
You are unable to move but can still take your action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Invisible</strong>
</p>
<p>
Make an RNG roll to be able to spot an invisible target. All combat rolls must be made using RNG as well. Hitting an invisible target makes them visible.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lost</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you are afflicted with this status, all navigation requires a successful Luck roll. Failure means the Server Host chooses where you go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paralyzed</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can’t move or take an action on your turn. All damage you take is doubled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Poisoned</strong>
</p>
<p>
You make all rolls using your Tilt dice. Failure marks a respawn. Respawning removes this status.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rage</strong>
</p>
<p>
You must attack the person or creature nearest to you. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sickened</strong>
</p>
<p>
You make all rolls with -1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Silenced</strong>
</p>
<p>
Cannot cast songs and voice communication doesn’t work. Cover your mouth or mute your microphone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sleeping</strong>
</p>
<p>
All attacks auto-hit and deal twice as much damage. If attacking a sleeping mob, the attack removes two dice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Slowed</strong>
</p>
<p>
You go at the end of initiative and can only move or only take an action on your turn. Not both.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stunned</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your turn is skipped this round of initiative.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tripped</strong>
</p>
<p>
Melee attacks against you count as crits if they hit. Ranged attacks treat you as partial cover. This status automatically ends at the end of your turn. No roll needed.
</p>
<h2>Continuing the Game</h2>


<p>
.dungeon doesn’t stop when you log out. Between sessions, time for the PC’s in the game world passes at the same rate as IRL time. This means that you are always playing .dungeon, even when you’re not logged on. Annwn is a world parallel to our own, that persists alongside our own.
</p>
<p>
	A typical .dungeon campaign will involve a session of adventure followed by a gap of downtime until the next session. The Server might talk to the players over discord or text message, asking them what their character is up to during these gaps. A player might want to log on and do some shopping in town. Or a player might have a friend they want to check in on. These things can happen (personal time permitting) while not having a full session, through talking and maybe rolling some dice when necessary.
</p>
<h4>Time</h4>


<p>
If you are always playing, and if time passes at roughly the same pace as reality, what about things that take more time than you have during a given night? Firstly, there aren’t many things like that in .dungeon except maybe grinding for drops or traveling over very long distances.
</p>
<p>
	Secondly, .dungeon has a golden rule: Whenever you sit down to play, if you want to take an action that requires more time than you have to play, it can be done retroactively. In other words, it happened during downtime. As long as you have the materials and the means, any long-term goal (shopping, talking to friends, grinding mobs, normal MMO tasks) can be accomplished retroactively. 
</p>
<h3 id="the_sun">The Sun</h3>


<p>
The eye of the sad god, pixelated and glowering. Like our moon here on Earth, the sun waxes and wanes, opening and shutting different amounts depending on how the eye is feeling. This activity changes the virtual world’s global lighting, shifting it in density, brightness, and even hue. Roll 2d6 to see what the sun looks like today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> Furious Crimson - Open wide, pupil miosis, harsh and sharp shadows
</p>
<p>
<strong>3-5.</strong> Confused Orange - Open wide, pupil dilated, long and blotchy shadows
</p>
<p>
<strong>6-8. </strong>Tired Purple - Three-quarters shut, wavering pupil, foggy and blurry shadows
</p>
<p>
<strong>9-11.</strong> Melancholic Blue - Half shut, watery pupil, no shadows
</p>
<p>
<strong>12.</strong> Asleep Navy - Fully shut, humming pupil, faint and dying shadows
</p>
<h4>Eclipses</h4>


<p>
After being severed, the left hand of Annwn joined the Sun in the sky as a celestial body. It rotates on a constantly shifting axis which puts it in varying degrees of eclipse with the Sun. When the correct eye and its proper hand sign coincide, Annwn casts her magic on the world. Every session, roll a d10. On a 1, there’s an eclipse. There can only be one eclipse each calendar month.

<p>
<strong>Melancholy</strong>
</p>
<p>
No shadows are cast when the sun is melancholic, so there are no eclipses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Asleep</strong>
</p>
<p>
When the sun sleeps and the hand passes in front of it, it creates a null magic aura for the entire server. Casting magic has no effect. Creatures who cast magic are vulnerable, and magical enchantments, auras, and protections (such as illusions) are dispelled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>January - Furious Horse</strong>
</p>
<p>
If a Rest Dice is rolled during this eclipse, it must be rerolled and the second number must be used. For better or worse.
</p>
<p>
<strong>February - Tired Bull</strong>
</p>
<p>
All healing from Rest Dice, spells, and foils is maximized during this eclipse.
</p>
<p>
<strong>March - Tired Crow</strong>
</p>
<p>
The illusion magic which hides secret doors within Annwn’s dungeons is broken, revealing them. During this eclipse, secret doors are marked with the symbol of the tired Eye.
</p>
<p>
<strong>April - Furious Hound</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Wyld Hunt event begins. This is known as Arawn’s Revenge, as the Drowned King’s influence spreads and his Black Hounds begin their hunt. All servers are bathed in a full and total red. Those lucky enough to defeat a Black Hound get an invite to Arawn’s castle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>May - Furious Frog</strong>
</p>
<p>
All Legendary catches while fishing are the Scroll Toad. If given a proper gift, the Scroll Toad will give you a single-use scroll that can summon him. When summoned, the Scroll Toad will devour one entity for you before vanishing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>June - Confused Elephant</strong>
</p>
<p>
Users who join and create their first character during this eclipse are “cursed.” They grow a set of unique horns on their head and begin with an invitation to Mazmorra, the cursed dungeon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>July - Confused Cub</strong>
</p>
<p>
Users who join and create their first character during this eclipse are born from the mouth of the dragon on Tutorial Island. They gain a patch of scales that they can customize to their liking and are able to understand the Ancient Tongue of dragons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>August - Tired Wolf</strong>
</p>
<p>
Players and NPCs inflicted with lycanthropy take on their werewolf forms during this eclipse. If they don’t find a cure by the end of the eclipse, they are stuck in werewolf form until the end of the next Tired Wolf eclipse.
</p>
<p>
<strong>September - Confused Butterfly</strong>
</p>
<p>
Only during this eclipse can a powerful spellcaster attempt to become a gLich. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>October - Tired Goose</strong>
</p>
<p>
All Bytes gained or found during this eclipse are doubled. Each shop has a 50% chance to double their prices for the rest of the week.
</p>
<p>
<strong>November - Furious Fox</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mobs have a chance of dropping Fox Tokens, which can be offered to foxes in-game. If a fox accepts your token, they are bound to you and will follow you as any other pet would. Foxes grant +2 to Vibes and Navigation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>December - Confused Snake</strong>
</p>
<p>
Inside Hafgan’s grave, his snake mount rests. Only during this eclipse does he awaken. See his stat block later on in the book for more information.

<h4>1. Amplified</h4>


<p>
Mountains stretch strange into the clouds. Crags and cliffs sheer, ebb, and collapse. Impossible structures of stone and rock. Nearly unclimbable faces of marble. Endless avalanches and earth that breathes deep through ravines and canyons filled with the most sought-after of treasures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mountain</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unlike other terrain, mountains require 2 supplies to travel. With a successful contest against the mountain’s 2d20, you can climb to the peak where a rare gem rests, worth 100 bytes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Canyon</strong>
</p>
<p>
Plunging into the canyon requires an additional supply, but inside all encounters have double the drops.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mountain (Unclimbable)</strong>
</p>
<p>
An procedurally generated horror of sharp edges and flat cliff faces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Living Mountain</strong>
</p>
<p>
It has stats and will try to hurt you. Defeating it turns it into a normal mountain until the next day.

<p>
<em>Advantage</em> - Living mountains roll their dice twice and take the higher of the two.
</p>
<h4>2. Astral</h4>


<p>
Dreamlike waves of solar lights dance amongst tree-tall flowers with faces while blue blood floats through the air as a spray of mist. Cracks in the ground that exit into the clouds. Floating islands that hold entire settlements and dungeons. A mystery and wonder of solitude. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Weeping Fields</strong>
</p>
<p>
The flowers spit out bits of dialog picked up from PUGs that travel through them. Hear the cursing and anger of a random encounter, the whispers of treasure in nearby dungeons and hexes. But only if you listen closely. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Floating Islands</strong>
</p>
<p>
Reaching them is the hardest part. They are mostly filled with dungeons, but on occasion there are untouched settlements with teleportation circles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Auroras</strong>
</p>
<p>
Occurs when Annwn’s debris falls and explodes into stardust. Multi-colored waves dance through the air, while sprinkles and sparkles of Annwn’s soul mingle. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Flying Castles</strong>
</p>
<p>
Massive dungeons that spawn on floating islands, creating miniature ecosystems of factionalized NPCs and mob horrors. 
</p>
<h4>3. Jaded</h4>


<p>
Silent hills rolling with fog. The midwest of America stretched thin. Telephone poles with nowhere to go, and the sounds of cicadas thick with the glow of the sad god’s eye. Ruins filled with zombies where your house sits, untouched and waiting for you. A hell of google-map textures. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Settlement Ruins</strong>
</p>
<p>
A few NPCs survive while others have long since become zombies. It’s common for hordes of zombies to assault ruins while NPCs still survive inside.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Roaming Fog</strong>
</p>
<p>
A haze, tinted by the eye of the sad god. It rolls and breathes with its own life, covering entire fields with its mass. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Moving Hills</strong>
</p>
<p>
Lumps of green, gray, and blue. Sidle past each other in the sunlight. Moaning and groaning. Sighing and crying. Alive. The most docile denizens of Annwn. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Giant Corpses</strong>
</p>
<p>
The corpses of Annwn’s largest creations, fallen from the debris belt, or slain by players long logged-out. If 100 Dream Materials are gathered, you can enter the corpse’s memories and fight the beast yourself. Or talk to it. It’s lonely.

<p>
<em>Resurrection </em>- If a player respawns, the Giant Corpse can resurrect their shadow to fight on the giant’s side. The shadow is linked to the party’s Sync and uses the same stats as the player. When the Giant Corpse is defeated, all shadows vanish.
</p>
<p>
<em>Summoning Foil</em> - Allows you to summon the Giant Corpse once.
</p>
<h4>4. Redlands</h4>


<p>
Bloody fields. Red and purple sands twisting around teeth that rupture from the ground to eat or just sit, monolithic. Tremors pulse through the fibers and code as deep machines pound away at unseen toils. The debris belt has never been so visible on a clear day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Debris Field</strong>
</p>
<p>
Blood red meteors fall from the sky. The rain is tinted with the blood of Annwn. Craters dot the fields. Monoliths of living rock and pulsating stone wriggle free from the dirt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Giant’s Teeth</strong>
</p>
<p>
Bone white spires erupting from the ground. The materials they produce are worth double, but harming the teeth calls an encounter immediately as the ground groans in pain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bleeding Wound</strong>
</p>
<p>
A cut, a gash, a slash. Cracks and craters that bleed blood from Annwn’s spinning body. NPCs can be resurrected if left to float in the pools for a day. Even a skeleton will reform its body and return to its routines.
</p>
<h4>5. Underworld</h4>


<p>
The sad god’s veins, still breathing and beating and filling with her juice. Darkened. She cannot see inside of herself. Only the horrors of the blackness and the ever churning blood. Caves and labyrinths that etch themselves through territories un-wiki’d, and never conquered. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fleshy Tunnel</strong>
</p>
<p>
The veins of Annwn that stretch inside and outside of the ground. When they flood (during the rain) they are impassable. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Abyssal Pit</strong>
</p>
<p>
A hole that goes down. Forever. Many NPCs are left falling for eternity. Traverse it carefully, if at all.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dragon Graveyard</strong>
</p>
<p>
The bodies of ancient dragons form caverns beneath the earth. They once erupted from Annwn’s body as her children. When tired and old, they return for their rest. Dragon Materials can be found here.
</p>
<h4>6. Wodes</h4>


<p>
Crying trees. A green and dead sea. Ancient and corrupt with broken lines of code. Ruled by families of wolves that have swallowed Her debris. Swamps filled with oil, constantly aflame. Crystal growths that rival the mountains. Time and space bend to the forests here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Melancholy Forest</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hazy groves, angry willow trees, vines that yearn for your neck. NPCs can’t help but cry. Mobs may fight, but they do so with sadness in their digital hearts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spider Forest</strong>
</p>
<p>
Webbed and impossibly claustrophobic. The spider priests wander these woods, looking for their lost god. Spiders furtively guide lost travelers to safety, knowing what the spider priests will do if they find you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lizard Forest</strong>
</p>
<p>
Crystalline and gleaming. Butterflies of blue glass beat their wings with water-like movements. Crystals found here can be sold for 20 bytes per inventory slot. Catching a crystalized lizard means nearly 100 bytes, but they also make for good pets (like normal lizard, but they reduce spell costs by 1). 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Black Swamp</strong>
</p>
<p>
Pools of oil and tar, bubbling and swallowing all entities that wind up in their liquid grasps. Fires set here will never go out. Pillars of flame from the earliest players still stretch up through tangled canopies.
</p>

6-8. Clear
</p>
<p>
9-11. Fog
</p>
<p>
12. Snow
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lightning Storm</strong>
</p>
<p>
Heavy thunder rumbles through the clouds blocking the sun from gazing upon Annwn’s body. In combat, there’s a 10% chance of a lightning bolt striking someone at random each round. When rolling random encounters, a 12 means that a lightning strike brings a Saga Prince. This is the only way to encounter a Saga Prince and get their unique drops.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rain</strong>
</p>
<p>
Flat, static-gray clouds with the dull sizzle of rain on every surface. Pets hide under their owners and NPCs gather in taverns. The world sleeps for the storm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Clear</strong>
</p>
<p>
The eye of the sad god watches.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fog</strong>
</p>
<p>
The thick liminality of static-fog. A pleasing film grain tinted by the glare of the sad god.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Snow</strong>
</p>
<p>
Flakes fall from the atmosphere, freezing bodies of water into slick surfaces and coating the world in a blanket of soft crunch. Dragons sing their sacred song. If you’re close enough, you can give up 10 Bytes to learn the song.
</p>
<p>
<em>Dragon Song</em>
</p>
<p>
Sing the dragon’s song and create an opening with your hands. A gust of astral air escapes it, freezing every mob in combat until the end of your next turn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Skill:</strong> Dream

<h3 id="dungeon">Shroedinger’s Dungeon</h3>


<p>
The silver rule of .dungeon’s world is that if you look for a dungeon, there will be one. In alleyways, in abandoned settlements, beneath taverns, in the middle of the wilderness. If you need a dungeon, there will be one there. And there’s one here. It’s a flowchart that can be followed using a d10 dice roll.

<h3 id="settlements">Settlements</h3>


<p>
Any collection of structures (or a singular structure of considerable size) can be considered a settlement as long as it contains an NPC. Settlements that lose their NPCs become ruins and spawn zombies, skeletons, and other undead. 
</p>
<p>
	Settlements are important because they are one of the few places that can be teleported to, and one of the few places players can respawn. They are also the only locations that can support a Guild House, allowing you to start a guild. And lastly, most equipment can only be bought or sold in settlements, because that’s where NPCs reside.
</p>
<h4>Rebuilding and Supporting</h4>


<p>
.dungeon was considered a “dead MMO” when the total number of players dropped below 1,000 and Annwn contained more ruins than it did settlements. But ruins can be reclaimed and turned back into settlements with enough Bytes and materials. See the Gear section for construction prices and times.

The stormlord crafts them into arrows of slaying, which they sell for 50 Bytes each. Arrows of Slaying auto-destroy the rest of their target’s dice if they lose the Contest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Toolsmith</strong>
</p>
<p>
Creates a hardware store in the settlement. Allows the settlement to sell equipment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Town Guard</strong>
</p>
<p>
Creates a warden’s office in the settlement. Has a 10% chance of having a traveling NPC in the barracks every month. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Unemployed</strong>
</p>
<p>
Can be trained and taken as apprentices to other jobs. Unemployed NPCs will also adventure with Player Characters for 2 Bytes per day. NPCs who go on adventures have a 10% chance at becoming adventurers themselves, though that means they’ll leave the settlement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Warlord</strong>
</p>
<p>
Will only stay in town if there are four defense towers. Generates a soldier NPC every month. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Weaponsmith</strong>
</p>
<p>
Creates a blacksmith in the settlement. Allows the settlement to sell weapons.
</p>
<h3 id="guilds">Guilds</h3>


<p>
To start a guild you must buy or craft a Guildhall (prices and materials in the gear section). The building process takes a full day of game time. Afterward, you have to name your guild, create an emblem for your guild, and create a flag for your guild that contains your guild colors. Here are the emblems and flags of some of .dungeon’s longest running guilds.
</p>
<p>
After starting or joining an existing guild, you are given the new role “Guild Member.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Guild Member</strong>
</p>
<p>
You are impervious to damage inside the Guildhall. Likewise, if your Guild Leader plants a banner, you gain +1 to all rolls while it stands.
</p>
<p>
All guilds also come with 20 slots of shared storage, a shared bank where members can store their Bytes, and a Respawn Anchor which, when active, allows all members to respawn at it instead of the nearest settlement. The Respawn Anchor can be moved by the Guild Leader.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Guild Banner</strong> - Costs 3 Fashion Materials, lasts for a single encounter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Black Ocean</strong>
</p>
<p>
They call themselves the “typical treasure hunters,” but they’re really information brokers. They buy information and sell it. They know most legendary quests. They know where most legendary weapons are hidden. How to get them. They sell that information to anyone with the Bytes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Happy Guild</strong>
</p>
<p>
Branded with the smile emoji, this guild is full of trolls and grifters. Organized only because it makes their trolling more efficient. Despite the waning popularity of the game, this guild is still hanging on causing problems for newbies and grizzled ancients alike. They camp settlements and PvP arenas to ambush lone players.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Scales</strong>
</p>
<p>
This wealthy group of players got together in the early 2000’s and dedicated their play time to balancing the game’s economy. They travel to places where other players have dumped bad gear into a market, or over inflated a settlement with too many Bytes, and they do what they can to stabilize it through trading.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Diamond Dogs</strong>
</p>
<p>
The self-described “knights” of .dungeon. They keep track of NPCs, their whereabouts, what they’re selling, if they’re in danger. And they protect them. Send a few guys to stand around and scare off the trolls and riff-raff. They use their potential lack-of-presence as a threat. If they don’t get what they want, they might just let the NPCs fend for themselves.
</p>
<h3 id="mods">Moderators</h3>


<p>
Individuals who have made a pact with Orion, the eight eyes of the sad god, become moderators. To do this, earn a moderator’s trust, get assigned a job, and if you complete it without hiccups they will take you to one of the eight eyes to make your pact. Tasks assigned by moderators include basic moderator duties, such as patrolling dangerous areas at night, protecting a settlement’s walls, maintaining goodwill with local guilds, and engaging in PvP against trolls and griefers. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Privileges</strong>
</p>
<p>
Moderators are given three special privileges. Mods found abusing their privileges will have them revoked and their moderator role stripped.
</p>
<p>
Silence - Target’s mic is muted globally for 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Freeze - Target’s avatar is frozen in place for 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Kick - Target is forcefully removed from the server and placed on a temporary (1 hour) ban. After a user has been kicked, all subsequent kicks will double the temporary ban.
</p>
<p>
Moderators can use their abilities throughout Annwn, but their domain is the settlements. They uphold the “no PvP in settlements” rule and seek to protect players from griefers and trolls. As a moderator you might be called on to assist others in their duties at any time while you’re logged on.
</p>
<p>
	Moderators are denoted by the purple halo that floats above their head. It sheds dim light, but other than that is purely cosmetic. Moderators who are stripped of their privileges lose the halo and are given a Jinx instead. Jinxes are small purple imps that hide in your shadow whenever they aren’t floating around your head. They offer no mechanical benefit and can only speak their name, “Jinx!”
</p>
<h3 id="admins">Admins</h3>


<p>
Administrators have the same privileges as moderators, but they also carry a Sword of Banishment. If a player or PUG is killed by a Sword of Banishment, they are permanently banned from playing the game, .dungeon, the book you’re currently reading, ever again. They can no longer make characters or participate in sessions of .dungeon ever, ever, never.
</p>
<h2 id="pugs">Players Unknown (PUGs)</h2>


<p>
Players Unknown (PUGs) are real people in the server who are also playing .dungeon. Interacting with them is different than interacting with anything else in the game. They don’t have to listen to the party, give them information, or do as the Party asks (like NPCs do). Stats and dice do not work on them unless you are engaged in combat. Each PC has their own internal and external wants and needs that they are in this game to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
	They have Sync, roles, aspects, and memories of the game. They are just as complicated and multi-faceted as you or I. Their only limitations are the internal mechanisms of the game. PUGs can be cruel and helpful. They can be streamers or roleplayers. They can have abilities from a previous patch, and gear that you can't even get in the game anymore. They are trolls, friends, rivals, and your companions in this dead MMO. 
</p>
<p>
	Below are a few tables to help you flesh out a PUG, but there is no shortcut to this. This is roleplay. It’s up to you to take these disparate results and find the complexity of a real person.

<h3 id="pug_hide">What They Actively Hide</h3>


<p>
This is their secret, the one they keep close to the chest. Sometimes they don’t even know that they’re hiding it. This is their past, their regrets. It’s all the things they don’t realize about themself.
</p>
<p>
Roll for a deep insecurity or subconscious thought that they have that affects their life. This could be something they hope to change or something that they will learn to live with. There are no wrong answers.
</p>
<ol>

<li>I can’t believe that anyone could even <em>think</em> they’re better than me.

<li>There’s not a law in the world that could stop me from doing what I want.

<li>There’s not much that gets me excited. Or sad. Or anything really.

<li>You’re not worth my time. No one is.

<li>Everyone’s better than me. I can list all the ways if you give me a minute.

<li>I’m so jealous of them. How do they do it?

<li>I rely on people for just about everything.

<li>Sometimes I forget to take care of myself. 

<li>I thirst for excitement at all times.

<li>I see the best in everyone! I even give my bully tips!

<li>No one invites me to parties. They call me a killjoy.

<li>I can’t stand it when things don’t go my way.

<li>I don’t believe there’s anything Up There. Life is meaningless.

<li>I can’t stand up for myself.

<li>I am obsessed with all the ways I could fail.

<li>There’s nothing I can’t do.

<li>I have no regrets. Especially not for those who have wronged me.

<li>I doubt everything.

<li>I live in the limelight. I require it.

<li>I can’t help but lie. It’s just so easy.
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pug_reason">Reason</h3>


<p>
Everyone in the game has a reason to escape into a fantasy world. These are not inherently tragic, but they are part of their personhood. This reason is part of their life at this moment and gives them Sync, just like you. Each PUG starts with d100 Sync and a reason to be online.
</p>
<ol>

<li>Summer vacation. They’re in junior high and just got the game.

<li>Boring office job drains their soul every day.

<li>Social anxiety has them retreating to a safe place within the game.

<li>First year at college, no irl friends yet.

<li>They are a rather popular author and need to maintain an online presence.

<li>Mother of two, trying to socialize beyond her children.

<li>Dad’s time after the kids go to bed. He streams sometimes.

<li>Hold-over from childhood. Been playing for 13 years.

<li>They’re dating another PC, but they still play alone sometimes.

<li>Professional esports gamer and this is their hobby game.

<li>Youtuber mining the game for content.

<li>Confused about their gender and trying out a new name and body online.

<li>Disability has them restricted to their home for most of the day.

<li>Quarantined at home due to an illness.

<li>Broke their leg while doing a keg flip and now they’re stuck in bed.

<li>Pregnant and trying to find new hobbies while at home.

<li>Recent bout of insomnia has them clinging to old hobbies.

<li>Using the game to hold onto their waning youth.

<li>They’ve found a way to turn it into a job that barely pays the bills.
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pug_PC">A Practical Way to Run Player Characters</h3>


<p>
When you’re running a PUG and you’re unsure of how to expand on them, roll a d6. The PUG can either share a piece of information about themself or, to take the pressure off the Server for a moment, they can ask a player one of these questions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>D6 - Result</strong>
</p>
<p>
1. Truth
</p>
<p>
2. Dare
</p>
<p>
3. Ghost
</p>
<p>
4. Secret
</p>
<p>
5. Funny
</p>
<p>
6. Family
</p>
<h4>Truth</h4>


<ol>

<li>How old are they?

<li>What’s their favorite color?

<li>Do they wear glasses?

<li>What do they study or do for work (if anything)?

<li>When did they start playing .dungeon?

<li>What’s something they’re very proud of?

<li>Do they look like their avatar?

<li>Any tattoos?

<li>Did they join or almost join the military?

<li>Favorite pair of shoes?

<li>What words do they overuse?

<li>What’s something they wish were true?

<li>Do they have any pets?

<li>Where do they live?

<li>Do they drive?

<li>Do they have a gaming rig or just a laptop?

<li>What’s their fondest memory of playing .dungeon?

<li>What’s their favorite video game?

<li>Favorite album or musical artist?

<li>What book do they think closely resembles their life?
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Dare</h4>


<ol>

<li>I dare you to fight the next encounter naked.

<li>I dare you to climb to the highest point nearby.

<li>I dare you to switch weapons with me for the next encounter.

<li>I dare you to not kill any mobs for the next encounter.

<li>I dare you to change your avatar into Shrek.

<li>I dare you to buy and wear the silliest gear we can find.

<li>I dare you to take care of yourself today.

<li>I dare you to go outside today and tell me about something pretty you see.

<li>I dare you to go hang out with a friend. In person. For just a little bit.

<li>I dare you to call that person you’re always talking about.

<li>I dare you to invite a friend to play .dungeon with us.

<li>I dare you to take me to your favorite spot in the game.

<li>I dare you to use all the foils in your bag and see what happens.

<li>I dare you to find and slay a dragon with me.

<li>I dare you to save up all your Bytes for the next month.

<li>I dare you to walk across the entire map. No fast travel.

<li>I dare you to fold your laundry today.

<li>I dare you to cook and eat a meal that’s not microwaveable.

<li>I dare you to enter the PvP arena. 

<li>I dare you to get high with me.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Ghost</h4>


<ol>

<li>Did they grow up rich or poor?

<li>What is their fondest childhood memory?

<li>What is their worst childhood memory?

<li>What smell takes them back into the past?

<li>What advice would they give their younger self?

<li>What’s the last thing that made them feel ashamed?

<li>When’s the last time they felt disappointment?

<li>When’s the last time they felt really proud?

<li>Has anyone ever saved their life?

<li>Have they saved anyone’s life?
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Secret</h4>


<p>
Secrets are pretty self explanatory, but they can be big or small. Anything hidden or kept close to the chest. Sharing something personal like this with another player can start a conversation and lead to a more intimate form of roleplaying. It might even be their “what they actively hide.” 
</p>
<h4>Funny</h4>


<p>
A great way to break up a silence or spice up travel is to have a character tell a funny story about a past adventure. Have them tell of a time when something went so wrong that they couldn’t help but laugh. Or a time when their party screwed something up and turned it into a farce. 
</p>
<h4>Family</h4>


<p>
Player Characters have parents, siblings, and kids as well. Talking about their family is an easy way to add depth to them while also finding inspiration for the rest of their character. Things like troubled relationships, fond memories, and strange living situations are relatable things to add to a three-dimensional character.
</p>
<p>
<strong>D10 Family Histories</strong>
</p>
<ol>

<li>Lives with extended family.

<li>Hasn’t spoken to them in years.

<li>Has a brother they’ve never met.

<li>Their father wasn’t around.

<li>They grew up at their grandma’s house.

<li>They moved around a lot.

<li>Their parents worked all the time.

<h3 id="reading_stats">Reading Stats</h3>


<p>
<strong>Number Appearing</strong>
</p>
<p>
The number next to a monster’s name is how many of them appear when encountered.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dice</strong>
</p>
<p>
Monsters are their dice. Some are made up of just one dice, others are made of multiple. When the first dice is beaten in a contest, it is removed. When a monster is out of dice, it’s dead. Notation is important: If a monster says 2d10, that means that two d10’s are rolled together and added for each contest. Conversely, d10x2 means that the monster has two separate d10’s that must be defeated. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dice Notation</strong>
</p>
<p>
This example uses d6’s to explain dice notation for stat blocks. 
</p>
<ul>

<li>2d6 means the mob rolls two d6’s and adds them together for each attack.

<li>d6x2 means the mob rolls one d6 for each contest, but when the first dice is defeated they have a second to take its place. 

<li>d6, d8 means the mob rolls a d6 until that dice is defeated and then rolls a d8. 

<li>d6/ means that the dice splits and gets smaller when defeated. The size of the dice will always follow the dice chain: D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, D4. Whichever dice is listed before the “/” is where you start, and dice only ever gets smaller.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These can be mixed and matched to make a stat block like the Manticore:

<strong>How do Monsters Attack?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When monsters win Contests, they deal damage directly to the party’s Sync. When initiative reaches the monster, roll one die per type of monster (so even if there are 10 goblins, just roll one die to represent them all) and deal that much Sync damage. This damage can be mitigated by Defense and shields.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stunts</strong>
</p>
<p>
When monsters win Contests, they can choose to perform a stunt instead, such as grappling or disarming a player. Any unique stunts are detailed here.
