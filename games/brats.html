<h2>brats</h2>

<h2 id="start">HOW TO PLAY</h2>


<p>
If you have a good plan or quality equipment, or if you’re attempting a trivial task, you succeed. If the action is risky, or if failure would be interesting, use the dice!
</p>
<p>
To resolve most actions, make a Check—roll d20 under a relevant Stat.
</p>
<p>
If you’re on the back foot, roll with Disadvantage: roll two of the same dice and take the worse result. For Advantage, take the better result.
</p>
<h2 id="stats">STATS</h2>


<p>
You have three Stats you use to interact with the world. At character creation, roll 3d6 for each, in order.
</p>
<p>
Fashion. Bodily prowess. Used for beef, determining Accessory slots, and your starting Popularity.
</p>
<p>
Talent. Reflexes and skill. Used for impressing and insulting.
</p>
<p>
Passion. Mental acuity. Used for determining Motivation and passing classes.
</p>
<h2 id="confidence">CONFIDENCE</h2>


<p>
Starting Confidence is equal to half of your highest Stat.
</p>
<p>
Spend a point of Confidence to have things go your way.
</p>
<p>
To test your Confidence, roll a d20 under your current Confidence to avoid catastrophe — whether you succeed or fail, reduce your Confidence by 1.
</p>
<p>
Every morning, set your Confidence to its starting value.
</p>
<h2 id="beef">BEEF</h2>


<p>
When necessary, determine Motivation by rolling d20 under your Passion. If you succeed, you decide when you act. If you fail, the GM does.
</p>
<p>
To hit an enemy with an attack, roll under a relevant Stat (Fashion for throwing hands, Talent for insults from afar), but over your opponent’s Looks.
</p>
<p>
When half of a single opponent’s Popularity is gone, or when half of a group of enemies is done for, roll under your Passion to see if they stay to fight, or if they run away or surrender.
</p>
<h2 id="popularity">POPULARITY</h2>


<p>
To determine your Popularity at character creation, roll d6 and add your Fashion score.
</p>
<p>
When you take damage, reduce your Popularity by that much. At 0 Popularity, roll d20 under your Confidence or switch schools. If you succeed, return to 1 Popularity and gain a Rumor (takes up a slot of your Accessories).
</p>
<p>
Regain d3 Popularity after showing off. A sleepover with your friends restores all Popularity. Successfully testing your Confidence for 1 week heals 1 Rumor.
</p>
<h2 id="clique">CLIQUE</h2>


<p>
When you roll your starting Popularity, consult this list. The d6 result also determines your clique:
</p>
<p>
1 HP. nerd. You start with 1 Secret. You have a good grasp over all of the subjects at your school.
</p>
<p>
2 HP. loner. You can turn invisible.
</p>
<p>
3 HP. goth. You can see the future or heal 1 Popularity when you smoke a cigarette. You start with 1 spell.
</p>
<p>
4 HP. best friend. You aren't known for much other than being the friend of someone else more popular than you. You roll your friend's Confidence instead of your own when in their vicinity. You start with 1 Secret.
</p>
<p>
5 HP. mean girl. You start with 2 Secrets. You can spread a Rumor once a week.
</p>
<p>
6 HP. cheerleader. You have a boyfriend on the football team and he'll beat people up for you. If your Popularity drops below half, he breaks up with you until it goes back up.
</p>
<h2 id="accessories">ACCESSORIES</h2>


<p>
You can wear a number of  accessories equal to your Fashion. Most accessories take up one slot, but each piece of clothing takes two. School supplies, like pencils or notebooks, take up no slots.
</p>
<p>
When your Popularity falls to 0, roll d20 under your Confidence or switch schools. If you succeed, you “live” (1 Popularity), but gain a Rumor. Rumors take up one slot of Accessory space—you can’t use that slot until the Rumor is dispelled.
</p>
<h3 id="rumors">RUMORS</h3>


<p>
I heard you and X … Y.*

<p>
* if the rumor doesn’t automatically make sense, double down.
</p>
<h2 id="secrets">SECRETS</h2>


<p>
You know what a secret is. If you have a secret, and someone knows it, they may turn it into a Rumor at any time. It is no longer a secret. These Rumors take up twice as many slots and take twice as long to dispel.
</p>
<h2 id="gear">Equipment</h2>


<p>
At character creation, everyone starts with school supplies, a week's worth of lunch money, a backpack, and an outfit. Roll for a starting style and accessory.
</p>
<p>
Unarmed attacks do 1 damage to them and yourself. Petty insults do d6 with Disadvantage, while a clever retort does d6. Low blows or referencing a Rumor does d6 with Advantage. Secrets deal 2d6 damage and also do something cool (like make them cry).
</p>
<p>
Looks come in styles: 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Prep

<li>Goth

<li>Nerd

<li>Jock

<li>Scene

<li>Skater
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="looks">LOOKS</h2>


<p>
Roll 2d6 for your starting weapon and associated accessory.
</p>
<ol>

<li>Prep - 2

<li>Goth - 1

<li>Nerd - 0

<li>Jock - 2

<li>Scene - 0

<li>Skater - 1
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Accessories can give advantage or disadvantage depending on the circumstances.

<h2 id="opposition">OPPOSITION</h2>


<p>
In order to do things that are directly opposed to another’s wishes or capabilities—like cheating on a test without getting caught, or flirting with someone else's boyfriend—roll under a relevant Stat and over your opponent’s Popularity or Level.
</p>
<h2 id="advancement">ADVANCEMENT</h2>


<p>
Every other session, or whenever you do something truly impressive, gain a Level. When you gain a Level, add 1 to your Popularity or attempt to improve one of your stats. To improve a Stat, roll 3d6 over your current score in that Stat—if you succeed, add 1 to it.
</p>
<h1 id="reference">Reference</h1>


<h2 id="time">TIME</h2>


<p>
In school, time passes in hour-long classes. You can do one meaningful thing each class. In between each class, roll for an encounter.
</p>
<p>
After school, time passes in Nights. A Night is the rest of the day, or the amount of time it takes you to study, go to a party, or wander around the local Wal-mart.
</p>
<p>
When Beefing, time is measured in Rounds. Each Round is a few seconds, time enough to say something witty, share a secret, or throw a punch.
</p>
<p>
Curfews allow you to stay out after dark (or until 10p.m.). Curfews only last for the night. You get a curfew by doing your chores. Staying out later gets you grounded.
</p>
<h2 id="exploration">EXPLORATION</h2>


<p>
You can travel to one Place each Night, or stay in your own house. If the Place is far away, it takes a car to get there.
</p>
<h3 id="encounters">ENCOUNTERS</h3>


<p>
When rolling for an encounter, roll a d6. On a 1 or 2, roll on your favorite encounter table. On a 1, the encounter happens immediately. On a 2, there is a sign of the next encounter, instead.
</p>
<h4>SAMPLE SCHOOL ENCOUNTERS</h4>


<ol>

<li>The three Chadsworth Brothers looking for a kid to shove into a locker.

<li>Hall Monitor already writing you a citation.

<li>Crowd gathering around a pathetic fight.

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="friends">FRIENDS</h2>


<p>
Friends are NPCs made loyal by favors and secrets. 
</p>
<p>
Roll 2d6+3 for friend stats as needed (or roll 2d6+6 instead for one that they excel at). Friends leave school at 0 Popularity.
</p>

<h2 id="extra_cliques">EXTRA CLIQUES</h2>

</ol>
<h2 id="school">Belmont High</h2>


<h3>Auditorium</h3>


<p>
The door into the seating area is right inside the school's entrance. It's dimly lit and empty except for a janitor. Up the stage and through the wings is a somewhat labyrinthine collection of rooms and hallways filled with costumes, props, and stage dressing. A trio of students are skipping class back here. It seems unlikely they'll be caught.
</p>
<h3>Library</h3>


<p>
Rows and rows of stacks, and a lot of tables. It's mostly empty. There is a librarian who glances up for a second when you walk in. Two scene girls are kissing in a corner rumored to be out of sight of the cameras. A camera was installed facing that direction last semester and is clearly visible. A row of computers lines the back wall.
</p>
<h3>Science Class</h3>


<p>
Sterile and larger than other classrooms, with lab tables and stools  instead of desks. Mr. Davis teaches chemistry here, and is overly willing to answer chemistry-related questions. He will hand out detention slips like candy if you start fucking around during a chem lab. The doors are locked when he's not in.
</p>
<h3>English Class</h3>


<p>
This classroom has windows facing the parking lot. The walls are covered with posters and quotes from famous authors, and there are bean bag chairs in a designated "reading corner". Miss Kennedy is one of the nicest teachers in the school, and doesn't mind if you fall asleep during classwork time. Many students take advantage of this until they learn she is also one of the harshest graders.
</p>
<h3>Math Class</h3>


<p>
This classroom feels cramped. There are tables, instead of desks, that seat two. The teacher got knocked up and has been out for a few months, and the rotating stable of substitutes can't get their shit together enough for this to be a real class. The same lesson has been taught the last 3 days in a row.
</p>
<h3>Cafeteria</h3>


<p>
Recently remodeled. It looks worse, and you can still see where they took the vending machines out. A large, cavernous room with rows of long tables on one end, and circular tables on another. The lunch ladies are always looking for people to help, and it's a good excuse to get out of class.
</p>
<h3>Principal's Office</h3>


<p>
Somehow never brightly-lit enough, even with overhead lights and large windows. The Principal always forgets to lock his door.  There's a few bookshelves in the room and an ancient computer on his desk. The principal himself, Mr. Allen, seems to be deathly afraid of eye contact.
</p>
<h3>Staff Lounge</h3>


<p>
Locked up tighter than Fort Knox. There's a glass panel by the door and a few real vending machines are visible next to the fridge meant for teachers' lunches. There's a table in the center, a coffee machine on the counter next to the fridge, and a couch.
</p>
<h3>Gymnasium</h3>


<p>
Always busy between the hours of 6 AM and 6 PM. Large room, high ceilings, bleachers that can retract back up, and basketball hoops. The track and basketball teams have to share on rainy days. Someone is always yelling for some reason, and the school nurse's number is on speed dial in the PE teacher's office. School assemblies are held here instead of the auditorium, for some reason.
