        <div id="game-text">
                <h2 id="start">Playing the Game</h2>

<p>To start playing, you need three to seven people, including the Disaster Master (or DM), character sheets, a few grids, some writing utensils and a decent number (at least six, but more is ideal) of six-sided dice. Like any good magical girl show, the action takes place in a number of Episodes or game sessions, over the course of one or more Seasons, or major and story arcs.</p>
<p><span>The rest of the players roleplay as magical girls—teenagers with special powers living a double life. </span><span>The transformation sequence is the split between a </span><span>Main Character (MC)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>being a regular person and someone truly magical. </span>An MC already had to be extraordinary to begin with—it’s how they were noticed by their mascot, but they were still mundane until the show began, the mascot came into their lives, and they acquired their magical weapons. The transformation sequence turns them into their magical persona, strong enough to deal with the big bad of the season. What happens to an MC when they transform can easily transfer to their everyday lives, whether that is a permanent scar or the horrifying ideal of discovery. Main Characters progress as a Team via their Power Level (PL).</p>

<h3>Rolling the Dice</h3>

<p>Outside of combat, play progresses through interactive roleplay—the DM says what’s happening, describing the immediate situation, and referees players actions. The MCs say what they do and how they go about it. But when the outcome is uncertain or the MCs transform, that’s when they roll dice. Often this will be a number of dice equal to their Primary statistic. If the number on a die is equal or less than the specified number (typically an MC’s Secondary statistic), it counts as a successful hit. A 6 on the die always counts as a miss. A 1 on the die always counts as a hit and explodes—roll another die, adding that die’s result to the total number of hits. If the new die lands on a 1, it explodes again, and this process repeats until you roll something else.</p>
<p>Example: If an MC’s Primary statistic is 4, and their Secondary statistic is 3, they roll 4 dice. Because their Secondary is 3, every die that is a 3 or lower counts as a hit, so a roll of 1-3-4-6, scores 2 hits The 1 result explodes, so the MC rolls an additional die and adds the result to the total. Exploding dice do not count toward the initial limit placed on how many dice rolled.</p>

<h2 id="creation">Creating a Character</h2>
<h3>Choose Weapons</h3>
<p>Choose two weapons, one to be your Main and one as your Offhand. Your Main weapon determines your Primary statistic and your Offhand weapon determines your Secondary statistic. So, if you choose the Baseball Bat as your Main weapon, and the Microphone as your Offhand, then your Primary statistic is Power, and your Secondary statistic is Charm. You may pick the same weapon twice. If your Primary and Secondary stats are the same, as in the case of picking the same weapon twice, use the listed “Alt” statistic as your secondary statistic instead. Each weapon comes with a set of traits—inherent features or bonuses. All of your weapons’ traits apply at the same time. </p>

<h3>Allocate Statistics</h3>

<p>You start with 6 points to allocate between your four statistics—Charm, Heart, Focus, and Power—all of which start at 1. The maximum any statistic can reach is 6. You also have four minor statistics derived from the main four: Spells Known, Harm Pool, Speed, and Saving Throw. Finally, your Burnout Points are equal to the Team’s Power Level.</p>
<p>Charm is your ability to persuade or captivate, but when you’re transformed, it translates into magical acuity. You know a number of spells equal to your Charm - 1.</p>
<p>Heart is your willpower and courage, as well as your capacity for taking harm mentally and physically. Your Harm Pool is equal to triple your Heart. </p>
<p>Focus is your mental acuity, clarity, and aptitude for thinking under pressure. It also contributes to your Speed in combat. Your Speed is equal to your Focus + Primary and expresses the amount of 5’ increments you may move in an action.</p>
<p>Power is your capability for intimidation and for shows of physical strength. You roll Power and count hits with Focus when rolling a saving throw.</p>

<h3>Choose Quirk</h3>

<p>Weapon quirks are usually physical modifications made to your weapon. You only have one permanent quirk affecting your weapon at a time and it must be chosen from your Main weapon. However, if you chose the same weapon twice, you may choose a second quirk.</p>
<p>You can gain an additional, temporary quirk while in combat from either your Main or Offhand weapons by using the Jury-rig maneuver. Quirks may also be changed during advancement.</p>

<h3>Choose Spells &amp; Abilities</h3>

<p>You gain a number of spells equal to your Charm minus 1, which means that every MC knows at least 1 spell. Choose a number of spells you know from the tier one list. You can replace spells during advancement. You gain more spells when your Charm statistic is raised, or in the place of learning an additional ability.</p>
<p>Abilities are the real meat of the weapon. Pick two tier one abilities from the options offered by your Main and Offhand weapons. You gain more abilities each Power Level (PL) during advancement, but may only select abilities from your chosen weapons.</p>
<p>Tier two spells and abilities are unlocked at PL 5, while tier three spells and abilities are unlocked at PL 8.</p>
<p>Spells have a default range of double the caster’s Charm and a duration of 1 turn. Abilities share a range with their associated weapon, typically melee (5’) and last until specified.</p>

<h2 id="advancement">Advancement</h2>

<p>Power Level measures the lessons learned and strength gained by the Team. There is no set time when the MCs increase in PL—when they have accomplished a goal they set together, when they have first defeated the Season’s antagonist and finally get some sleep, when they escaped the cursed, labyrinthine mall they were trapped in for three Episodes—these are all times that may conclude with a Power Level boost determined by the DM. A Team of MCs begin at PL 1 by default.</p>

<h3 id="hat">Hat</h3>

<p>STATISTIC: Charm</p>
<p>ALT STATISTIC: Heart</p>

<p>Trait: Familiar</p>
<p>You craft, summon, conjure, or befriend a familiar, who may act on your turn and who uses your actions. They may attack with their own stats, use maneuvers, and move. This familiar can be of any form or shape, from your loyal dog, your sentient weapon, to an alarmingly helpful eldritch entity. Though this familiar uses your actions, they have their own attack roll (unless you have the Helmet quirk), and their own Harm Pool. It may be helpful to give them their own sheet to track them. Refer to the Enemy statistics table for their statistics based on the Team’s PL. If a familiar is hit with a killing blow, all excess harm is funneled through the Hat and to the MC. Familiars regain 1d6 of their HP at the beginning of each subsequent round while dead, and may be resummoned after at least one round by taking an action to pull them out of your hat.</p>

<p>Trait: Sentience</p>
<p><span>Your familiar is not just a mindless entity, they have opinions, feelings, attitudes and priorities. They can communicate, too, with you and everyone else around them. Roll or select from the Purpose and Attitude tables in the Magical Mascot section of the Appendix. If your familiar may disagree with an action you ask it to take, roll 1d6 to convince it. </span><span>On a </span>6, it does something else. On any other number, it does what you ask of it.</p>

<p>Quirks</p>
<p>Cowboy Hat: Your familiar is large enough to be ridden, and ride it you do. If your familiar is adjacent to you when you move, you may use its movement speed instead of yours. You travel together, taking up space as one.</p>

<p>Witch Hat: Because of your special connection, you gain a third action each turn only for it to use.</p>

<p>Bonnet: Your familiar is as sweet and dainty as the frilly bonnet you wear. Enemies are hesitant to attack it—all enemies are Bewitched by your familiar until they perceive it taking a harmful action.</p>

<p><span>Helmet: Your familiar is not just your familiar…it's your weapon as well! </span><span>You may use abilities through your weapon as if you were there,</span>&nbsp;but you may only make basic attacks when you're not holding it. A sentient weapon is able to move separately from the MC.</p>

If the enemy hits the wrong hat, it explodes in a burst of confetti, setting the enemy Aflame. The hats last 3 turns, or until you or the ally attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mad Hatter</strong><br>Utility
</p>
<p>
Why is a raven like a writing desk?

At the beginning of the round, stunned enemies roll 1d6, and on a 6, the Stun ends and is now afflicted with Taunt towards you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tentacle Tantrum</strong>
</p>
<p>
Harm
</p>
<p>
You pull off your hat, revealing the many oil-black tentacles of a monster that resides within. It grabs and throws enemies and allies alike at random within burst equal to your Charm.

<p>Metal Flash: You may Bewitch an enemy within your attack range for 1 turn every time you unsheathe your weapon.</p>
<p>Greatsword: Your weapon isn’t a katana, but a massive, two-handed sword even bigger than you are. You gain +2 Primary from Iaijutsu, instead of +1. </p>
<p>It’s On Fire Now?: Your katana is on fire. If your dice explode at least once on your attack roll, the target is set Aflame.</p>

<h2 id="team">The Team</h2>

<p>The Team is the name for the group of magical Main Characters. It can be a literal Team, like a baseball or debate team, or it can be a club, sorority, or just a group of friends. Some Teams might not even know each other until they’re all forced together by the circumstances! Teammates are all considered allies, regardless of in-fighting or drama.</p>

<h2 id="mascot">The Mascot</h2>

<p>One of the key parts of any Team is the Mascot. For some, the Mascot is the source of all the powers—for others, it’s simply drawn to you because of the powers you have acquired. Sometimes the Mascot may be the very thing that led you, in whatever way, to gaining powers in the first place. But be careful, because they won’t always tell the truth.</p>

<p>As a group, roll or decide the form your Mascot takes. </p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>

<p>Combat consists of turns, collected into rounds. A round completes once every combatant takes their turn. To determine who goes first, MCs roll a number of dice equal to their Primary, and count hits equal to or below their Focus. The MC who gets the most hits takes the first turn. If there is a tie, the character with the highest Focus breaks the tie. If no MCs’ roll exceeds the highest Initiative value among the enemies, an enemy of the DM’s choice goes first instead.</p>

<p>After the first MC or enemy acts, they choose who takes the next turn. If they choose an ally, that ally must then choose an enemy. Enemies at PL 0 (cannon fodder) act together as a group while adjacent.</p>

<p>The last to act chooses who goes first at the start of the next round, limited by the same choice restrictions of subsequent allies.</p>

<p><span>Enemies and MCs alike have two actions each turn, and one turn each round. An MC may use an action to attack, maneuver, move, or use an </span><span>ability or spell</span>.</p>

<h3 id="move">Move</h3>

<p><span>When MCs spend an action to move, they move in increments of 5’ equal to their Speed (Focus+Primary). An MC with 3 Focus and 2 Charm (their Primary) has 5 Speed (25’). Moving over rough terrain and the like incurs a -2 penalty to your Speed. If Focus is the MC’s Primary statistic add Focus twice</span>&nbsp;for Speed.</p>

<h3 id="attack">Attack</h3>

<p>A basic attack uses one action. MCs roll a number of dice equal to their Primary. Results less than or equal to their Secondary count as hits and inflict an equal amount of harm to the target. Most harm abilities also include at least one attack with their extra effects. A basic attack is simply an attack rolled without using an ability. Attacks of any kind are considered successful if they scored at least 1 hit.</p>

<p>A MC’s ability to attack at range depends on their weapon traits, but all MCs are capable of attacking in melee (adjacent).</p>

<p>Example: An MC makes a basic attack against an enemy goblin. They roll 5 dice for the attack, because their Primary is 4, and they have a bonus die from a previous Invoke maneuver. The results are 1-2-2-3-6, but 1s explode so they roll another die, landing on another 3. Their Secondary statistic is 3, so they count five total hits, inflicting five harm.</p>


<h3 id="status">Status Effects</h3>

<p>Status effects are any ongoing condition or modifier. The most common way to gain status effects is through maneuvers and abilities (eg Bolster or Invoke). Some enemies or MCs cause afflictions—powerfully debilitating status effects. Status effects are counted by round, not by turn. Harm and saving throws for afflictions are taken at the beginning of each round, before the first turn is taken.</p>

<h3 id="maneuvers">Maneuvers</h3>

<p>MCs may use an action to maneuver. Some spells and weapon abilities make use of maneuvers. Any effects from maneuvers are considered status effects.</p>

<p>Assist: Through encouraging words or active assistance, you grant an ally an additional die to their next roll, whatever it may be.</p>

<p>Bolster: By taking a defensive stance, the next attack made against you suffers -1 Primary. Must be your last action of the turn.</p>

<p><span>Invoke: Whether you aim your Gun or channel more power through your Baseball Bat, Invoke allows you to take an action to prepare for your next attack. Before the end of your next turn, you gain +1 die die to your next roll, whatever it may be. This can stack twice</span>.</p>

<p><span>Jury-rig: Whether you're channeling magic from the heart or tinkering with a bad idea, Jury-rig allows you to modify your weapon temporarily. Add another quirk to one of your weapons until you are reduced half HP</span><span>.</span></p>

<p>Protect: You position yourself in front of an ally within your Speed. Any attacks made towards that ally miss on a 5 and a 6 instead of just a 6, and a successful attack results in harm being split 50/50 between you and your ally.</p>

<h3 id="afflictions">Afflictions</h3>

<p><span>Harm from afflictions is taken at the beginning of </span>each new round. MCs and Bosses can roll to resist afflictions when they are first applied (saving throws apply). Likewise, they can make a save at the beginning of the round to get rid of an affliction, once for each affliction. All other enemies cannot resist afflictions, and only roll 1d6 at the beginning of subsequent rounds—on a 6, the effect ends.</p>

<p>Aflame: Suffer harm equal to the user’s PL. Cannot cast spells until the fire is put out.</p>

<p>Bewitch: Cannot take any offensive actions towards the target(s), but may take defense and utility actions.</p>

<p>Bleed: Suffer one harm.</p>

<p>Crush: This status effect only affects specific weapons, attacks, and body parts. The enemy is unable to use the Crushed weapon, ability, or body part.</p>

<p>Entangled: Suffer a -2 Primary to all attacks. Usually requires an action to get untangled. Attacks against Entangled targets gain +2 Secondary.</p>

<p><span>Poison</span><span>: </span>The target suffers -1 Primary when attacking or using a harm ability.</p>

<p>Stun: Cannot take any actions.</p>

<p>Taunt: Forced to attack or move into range to attack the target.</p>


<h3 id="abilities-spells">Abilities and Spells</h3>

<p><span>Spells and abilities cost one action to use unless otherwise noted. Abilities may include making an attack, or a maneuver as part of their effects. Whenever an MC casts a spell or uses an ability, they accumulate Burnout Points equal to the tier of the spell or ability. </span>Spells and abilities do not require a roll to make unless they include an attack or similar. </p>

<p><span>Spells and abilities have a type: harm, defense, familiar, and utility, which may synergize with certain other effects. Passive abilities require no action to activate. All ranges for spells and abilities are in 5’ increments and last a number of turns from when the MC used it. So an ability with “range equal to your Charm” and your Charm was 3, the ability has a range of 15’. </span><span>Spells have a default range of double the caster’s Charm and a duration of 1 turn. Abilities share a range with their associated weapon, typically melee (5’) and last until specified.</span></p>


<h3 id="aoe">Areas of Effect</h3>

<p>Some spells or abilities occur over an area and affect multiple targets, known as their area of effect, or AOE. Spells and abilities with AOE affect all targets within an area, unless otherwise stated. </p>

<p>Burst: Affects all targets within the listed range from the point of origin, in all directions.</p>

<p>Aura: Affects all targets within the listed range from the point of origin, in all directions, and is sustained.</p>

<p>Line: Affects everything within a 5’ wide line from the point of origin to a specified length.</p>

<p>Cone: Affects all targets within an expanding triangular shape from the point of origin, up to the listed range. Cones expand in increments of 5’.</p>


<h3 id="saves">Saving Throws</h3>

<p><span>When an MC or Boss is at risk of an affliction, they make a saving throw. Roll Power, and count hits equal to or below Focus. If the resulting hits </span>equal to or exceed the amount of successful hits that caused the affliction, the affliction or effect is prevented. If an affliction was not the result of a roll, save against the PL of the affliction’s source.</p>

<h3 id="hp">Harm Pool</h3>

<p><span>The Harm Pool measures an MC’s capability for getting hurt before they're killed. </span><span>Every MC has a Harm Pool equal to three times their Heart.</span></p>

<p><span>MCs</span><span>&nbsp;may opt to avoid a single killing blow per Episode with a permanent scar. If they do, they immediately Push Your Limits and suffer no harm from the enemy action. This scar is forev</span>er visible when you are transformed, but may or may not be visible when you are mundane. </p>

<p>Once you surpass your Harm Pool, you’re knocked out. Enemies tend to ignore knocked out MCs, but they must be tended to with the Assist maneuver within three turns or they die. Assisted allies are still unconscious, but recover to 1 HP when the encounter ends.</p>


<h3 id="bp">Burnout Pool</h3>

<p><span>The Burnout Pool measures the Team’s mixture of stress, exertion, and the exhaustive nature of magic. </span><span>Burnout Points (BP) are accumulated as MCs cast spells or harm abilities at a value equal to the tier of the spell or ability used</span>.</p>

<p>Higher Power Levels means the Team can accrue more and more burnout before they begin to feel the effects. The Burnout Pool is a soft cap—MCs may continue to use spells and harm abilities over this cap, but the higher it goes, the higher the chance of failure. When an MC uses a spell or ability, roll 1d6, adding +1 to the total for each point exceeding the Team’s Burnout Pool. If the total is 6 or higher, the MC’s action fails and they suffer one harm.</p>

<h2 id="limits">Push Your Limits</h2>

<p>Sometimes your best just isn’t good enough. When that happens and you’re facing down a horde of enemies, your power, magic, and adrenaline mix together into something more.</p>

<p>An MC cannot push their limits until they reach any two of the three following requirements. Pushing your limits does not require an action, but must be done during the MC’s turn.</p>

<p>Requirements</p>

<p>Outnumbered: Either there are far more enemies than your team, or you’re the last one standing against a Boss.</p>

<p>Almost Dead: Either from a single massive hit or the attacks of many, you’re down to 1 HP.</p>

<p>Burnt Out: Your Team is at least 1 point over their BP.</p>

<p>This effect lasts 3 turns. At the start of your turn, you may forgo an effect in order to extend the duration by 1 turn.</p>

<p>Harder to Hit: Attacks against you suffer -2 Primary.</p>
<p>Hit Harder: Your attacks gain +2 Primary.</p>

<p>Play is divided into Episodes and Seasons. An episode is an individual session of play—a single night, a chapter of the story, the two hours you have before your shift starts. A Season is a collection of Episodes bound together by a central Antagonist at the source of each Episode's threats.</p>

<p>Plan your Season around an Antagonist with an evil goal such as world domination, poisoning the atmosphere, or mutating wildlife into insidious beasts. Each Episode then revolves around the Antagonist's minions, allies, and underlings attempting to further that goal while the MCs work together to oppose them, through a mixture of heroics, coincidence, and investigation. Each episode should hint at or reveal information about the Antagonist and their ultimate goal.</p>

<p>To create and run a Season:</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Settle on your Antagonist, some of their minions, and create their evil plan. Think like a cartoon character.</li>
<li>Break the plan into steps. These are your Episodes.</li>
<li>Allow the Antagonist to adapt to the threat of the Team.</li>
<li>Always escalate. Remember! Think like a cartoon villain.</li>
<li>Have fun being the villain.</li>
</ol>


<p>Example Antagonists: </p>
<p>The Lord of Hell releases waves of devilish creatures into your hometown to establish a stronghold to take over Earth, and then Heaven. He uses cultists, lesser demons, and corrupted politicians to carry out his will. Episodes include establishing a cult in the school, getting a lesser demon elected to office, and stealing all the puppies from town to use as sacrifices.</p>

<p>A nameless Alien from the infinite dark between the stars, attempts to corrupt the planet into darkness, or turn all of the people within to monsters. The Alien uses mind controlled civilians, alien soldiers, mutated local pets to further their inscrutable ends. Episodes include sending an asteroid with an evil alien parasite, interrupting the school dance with a mutated pet, and sending a warrior priest to hunt the Team down.</p>

<p>The NAME corporate headquarters reside in your city. But people have started to go missing and wildlife has started dying after their announcement of a new, innovative beauty product. NAME corporation uses faceless corpo-goons, massive industrial projects that suck the life from the planet, and mecha to test their agenda. Episodes include students going missing after a school trip, a new factory pops up overnight, and corpo-goons start tearing down the local forest.</p>

<p>The former Team of MCs led by your Mascot is out for revenge. They use aged fans, the lesser magical girls, and animal companions to harass the Team. Episodes include attacking an anime convention, your fans or classmates turn&nbsp;on the Team as the old MCs spread propaganda, and a hostage situation at the school.</p>

<p>To create an episode:</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Break the Antagonist’s goal into smaller steps. These are your Episodes.</li>
<li>Begin with a strange occurrence. The henchmen are beginning the plan.</li>
<li>Investigation! The Team lives their non-magical lives while searching for clues.</li>
<li>Entangle their non-magical lives with the henchmen’s plans.</li>
<li>Let it end with a big fight as the MCs transform!</li>
</ol>


<p>The hardest choice for the Team is whether to prioritize their real lives or saving the world. As a DM, your job is to make that harder. Entangle them together by pushing on real-world priorities: homework, day jobs, chores, pets, family. The Antagonist and their underlings can take hostages, make threats, or lead fights into populated areas.</p>

<p>To add some complications to your encounters, and create tension between the MC's magical and mundane identities, roll or choose from the Complications Table.</p>

<h3 id="strats">Fighting Strategies</h3>

<p><span>Crowd control and status effects are important. The MCs cannot easily survive without controlling the battlefield</span><span>. Enemy dice explode too, and combat tends to be lethal. Fights can end quickly, but can be surprisingly draining and dangerous to the MCs as they fight on.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>A decisive victory and a hard-fought victory are satisfying to the players in different ways. </p>

<h3 id="enemies">Enemies</h3>

<p>Enemies have Five stats: Power Level, Primary, Secondary, Harm Pool, and Initiative. </p>

<p>The PL of an enemy is a rough indication of its difficulty. A Team of three MCs at PL 1 can reasonably handle three PL 1 enemies. However, that same Team will struggle against three PL 2 enemies and be in dire straits should they encounter that many PL 5 enemies! Keep this in mind when designing encounters. </p>

<p>An enemy’s attack works how it does for MCs. You roll the enemy’s Primary and each one that matches or is lower than their Secondary is a hit.</p>

<p>An enemy’s HP measures how much harm they can take before they are defeated. More HP means they live longer and get to beat on the team more.</p>

<p>An enemy’s Initiative is a static number representing how many hits the team needs to get to go first. The higher number an enemy has for initiative, the more likely they’ll go first and get the drop on the team.&nbsp;Likewise, an enemy’s Initiative&nbsp;is also their Speed.</p>

<h3>Enemy Traits</h3>

<p>Much like weapon traits, enemies can have unique features to make them more difficult. As a rule of thumb for applying traits to enemies, assign one trait for every two to three Power Levels.</p>
<p>Armored: Ignores 1 harm per attack made against them. Always has an unarmored weak spot.</p>
<p>Big: Half Speed, double HP. Their melee attacks have a 10’ range.</p>
<p>Elusive: Harder to hit and harder to see. Attacks made against them suffer -1, or -2 if the attack is ranged.</p>
<p>Fast: Faster than most normal people, and faster than most MCs, too. Add +1 to their Speed, and +1 to their Initiative.</p>
<p>Magic: Choose two spells of an appropriate tier for their PL. They are able to cast these spells.</p>
<p>Ranged: Can make a ranged attack with range equal to their Speed.</p>
<p>Strong: Can lift or throw objects as big or heavy as a car.</p>
<p>Summoner: Once per Episode, summon a number of creatures equal to the Team’s PL.</p>

<h4>Cannon Fodder</h4>

<p>Enemies of PL 0 are intended to be used for swarms or as summons for other PL enemies. In the case of summons, they act on the turn of their summoner.</p>

<h4>Enemy Witches</h4>

<p><span>Some games may want to use enemies that are much the same as the MCs. In this case, build the enemies like you would an MC, and in some cases, you may want to allow these enemies to Push Their Limits. In general, look at keeping the number of Witches and their PL the same as the number of MCs.</span>&nbsp;Enemy Witches are always considered Bosses for the purposes of saves, abilities, and spells. They make great episode bosses, or even Season antagonists!</p>

<h3>Enemy Stats</h3>

<p>Most enemies do not usually need to be fully fleshed out with all of their statistics and traits.</p>
