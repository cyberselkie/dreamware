                <em>Once upon a time, two gods lived together in our sky. The god of love and the god of death. Two great and powerful foxes who danced as one. Until one day, in a fit of jealous rage, the god of love was killed and fell from the sky. Now there is but one god. Our sorrowful and tired god who sleeps inside the moon.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                <em>With death asleep, and love gone, spirits no longer find their way to rest. The dead rise and wander under her crescent glow. Ghosts remain where flesh once was. Bones refuse to settle. Spirits twist and churn into beasts, destroying all in their path, seeking an end to their suffering. No one prays, for they fear what shall happen when she wakes.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                <em>Sometimes those that die return intact. Chosen by Love, some clamor. Cursed by Death, bemoan others. They are changed strange by their liminality. Mutated. Made supernatural. Gifted with otherworldly power. These folk are the canary in the coal mine of the moon’s nightmare. The only hope for a spirit to join the moon in her slumber. Songbirds.</em>

                <h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                A Songbird can be measured using four broad categories. Assign 5 points across them on your character sheet. Add your Stat to d20 rolls when making a check.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Physique </strong>(PHY) - Power of the body and the knowledge/control of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Reflex </strong>(REF) - Finesse, balance, agility, and reaction time.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Lore </strong> (LOR) - What you know about the world and how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Charisma </strong>(CHA) - Your will and spirit interfacing with the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Inventory</strong>: Characters can carry 8 + PHY items. Carry more and mark a death box.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Languages</strong>: Everyone can speak common, also known as “the Queen’s Tongue,” and their own, local language. If your Lore is 3 or higher you get another language. Some cool ones include: french, valley song, or communist.
                </p>
                <h3 id="save">Save</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                Songbirds make saving throws to shake off negative effects at the end of their turn by rolling a d20. Getting a 10 or higher is a success and ends the effect. When coming up against obstacles, their effects, either supernatural or not, take effect immediately. Save ends. You can always choose to fail a save if you wish &lt;3
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>D20</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The main tool used to answer questions. The higher you roll, the better it can go.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>D10</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Used for just about everything else, including damage rolls, luck, downtime activities, and various other GM rolls.
                </p>
                <h3 id="checks">Checks</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                Songbirds roll d20 + Stat/Skill against a Difficulty (DC) to figure out what happens when the answer isn’t obvious. Succeeding a check means the songbirds were right. Failure may mean a more dramatic answer, like a setback or complication.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Difficulty</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                
                <li>6 - simple
                
                <li>8 - routine
                
                <li>10 - easy
                
                <li>12 - normal
                
                <li>14 - hard
                
                <li>16 - heroic
                
                <li>18 - impossible
                
                <li>20 - lol, lmao
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                <strong>Ask for help</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Game Masters choose a difficulty based on their intuition. Sometimes it’s not obvious or doesn’t come easy. In that case, ask the songbirds.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Advantage/Disadvantage</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Roll 2d20 and take the higher (advantage) or the lower (disadvantage). 
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Critical/Fumble</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Rolling either a 20 or a 1 on a d20 means things are about to go your way or turn against you.
                </p>
                <h3 id="luck">Luck</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                Luck is a catchall tool for the Game Master to answer questions about the world and its inhabitants. Whenever the GM doesn’t know the answer to a songbird’s question, they can choose “high or low” and roll d100 to see if things favor the songbirds or not.
                </p>
                <ul>
                
                <li>High is 55 and above.
                
                <li>Low is 54 and below.
                </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="hp">Hit Points</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                HP. You begin with 5 + PHY. Or you can roll a d10 + PHY for a chance at more and risk getting less. HP is a crude and brutish way to measure you life. When it’s reduced to 0, you’re at death’s door and must make a saving throw whenever it’s your turn to act.  Mark a death box if you fail. You die if all three are marked. Rolling a 20 means you dig deep and regain d10hp. Any additional damage you take while at death’s door automatically marks a box.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Recovery</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Characters naturally recover 1hp per day. Medicine, magic, or good company can also recover hp. Death boxes recover at a rate of 1 per session.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Massive Damage</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                When you take an amount of damage equal to double your HP at once, lose two or more death boxes at one time, or suffer a critical hit while on death’s door, roll below:
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>1-60. Dead</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>61-94. Messy Death</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Your body is horribly mangled by the damage. The brutality of it is sudden and seared into the minds of those around you. All survivors must save or become horrified. There is nothing left of your body to take back and all items are destroyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>95. Dismembered!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The damage mangles or removes a body part. You get to decide based on the attack. This gives you a -2 to all rolls involving that body part for a week. There are special doctors in the City that specialize in body modification. They operate on dismembered adventurers for a very reduced rate, opening up your character to specialized augments. (see page 44)
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>96. Glimpse the Cave</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                You saw the afterlife. An endless cave swallowed by a living darkness. You are alone. Forever. This is what comes after. This is where spirits come from... And then you wake up.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>97. Beautiful Scar</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The damage scars you, but in a sexy way. When people see this scar, they know you’ve seen some shit. Raise your CHA by 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>98. Split Eye</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                You have seen more and known more than is natural. Your iris pulls slightly apart, like a cell reproducing. It stays like that, in a budding state. You can now see beyond magical illusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>99. Vessel</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                For a brief moment, your spirit was shoved aside. You now share your body with another.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>100. Blue Shift</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                For a moment your brain existed in tandem with the Moon’s dreams. If they open your skull and look inside, your brain will be blue. You can now use Psychic Abilities. (see page 56)

                <p>
                You and the rest of the people you’re playing with are a gang. A party. A group. A community. Songbirds form gangs to travel safely and share expenses while not traveling. Your gang doesn’t need to be large. Anywhere from 2-50 songbirds can form a gang and go on adventures. The more songbirds in a gang, the more likely you’ll need other Game Masters to run additional games. Sometimes big gangs will splinter off into smaller ones, traveling in the same world, doing their own thing.

                </p>
                <p>
                Every gang has a few rolls that can be taken on by one songbird or shared amongst several. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Leader </strong>- The leader describes plans to the GM to assure that everyone is on the same page. 
                
                <li><strong>Watcher </strong>- Keeps an eye out and rolls encounter checks.
                
                <li><strong>Cartographer </strong>- Keeps the maps. You don’t need to be an artist. Just draw boxes on paper and label them with the places you’ve been and things you’ve seen. Connect the boxes with lines showing how you got in/out/. Note the time it took to get from box to box. This is a map.
                
                <li><strong>Stenographer </strong>- Write down the people you meet, the things you hear about, and the leads you’re told. You never know what piece of information might be important later.
                
                <li><strong>Historian </strong>- In charge of the calendar. Write down important events, mark the seasons, name your own holidays, and mark down other songbird’s birthdays.

                Songbirds, as a game book, assumes that you’ve already lived enough life to have died. It also assumes that you were chosen to become a Songbird and returned to life with the weird powers you have written on your character sheet.

                This is a lot of assumptions. Roll on the “where do we begin?” table to jump right into a campaign. Each player can then roll on the “Do we know each other?” table with the person on their left (if playing in person) or with the person below them (if playing over voice/text chat).

                Songbirds grow in power by going on a dream journey after a successful quest or session. This should be done outside of the session between the GM and the player. It can be done over text sporadically until the next session. No rush.

                <p>
                You dream of the Wilderness. Love is in the sky, smiling down on you while Death circles her joyously. You must hunt. Catch a meal for Love and carry it to her. Roll 3 saves. Best two out of three. Success means you do this and get a gift from Love. Failure means you awake, unable to rest that night. Regain no HP.

                Special doctors in the City do body mods for Songbirds who have been injured in the line of duty for 250c per. Each body modification is tied to a Stat and allows you certain benefits at maintenance cost, either per use or per session. A Songbird can only have one body modification per Stat, simply because you run out of room in the standard human body. To have more modification slots installed costs 1,000c per modification.

                Spells require extensive knowledge of runes and the time needed to draw them clean and proper. The common tool for this sort of artistry is chalk. Sticks of chalk cost 1 coin a piece and can draw a single ritual. Chalk counts as a bundled item.
                </p>

                <strong>Rituals</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                There are two types of rituals, those that take a dungeon round and those that take a segment of time. Each ritual will detail the space and time needed to draw the symbols. At the end of each ritual, a magician adds their unique arcane sigil. This is traceable. A lot of spells function based on where you place your sigil, when it is touched, or if it gets destroyed. Create your own unique sigil somewhere on your character sheet.

                </p>
                <p>
                Along with the chalk process, rituals require materials which cost coins. Each spell lists its cost next to it’s type (i.e. - Ritual 4 means it’s a ritual that costs 4 coins). When drawing a ritual, the coins aren’t removed from your character until the ritual is complete, even if the sigil hasn’t been activated at that time.

                <strong>Copying Spells</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                To learn a new spell, you must have the full ritual in front of you to study, whether it is in a book or drawn onto some surface. Each time you study the spell during downtime mark a segment of an easy clock. When it’s filled, the spell is added to your tome.
                </p>

                <p>
                Rituals can be cast from other sources than your own tome, such as from a scroll or another wizard’s book. But magicians tend to put lies in their tomes to protect their own magics. Roll below to determine the veracity of a source of magic other than your own tome. Casting a spell from another source than your tome requires a DC10 plus whatever is rolled below.

                <p>
                This spell triggers when your sigil is tampered or damaged. Roll a d10 to determine the magnitude, rerolling 1’s and 2’s. If done over a dungeon round, the effects last for the next dungeon round. If done over a segment, the effects last as long but are more devastating.

                Water spews out of your arcane sigil like an open hydrant and will continue to do so until the sigil is damaged by the water or another source.

                <p>
                This ritual circles around a target and releases their spirit from their body. While free, the spirit can roam the world without chains and is protected from other spirits. If the circle is damaged, other spirits can possess the body. If the body is removed from the ritual circle, the spirit cannot return to the body.

                Create a portal to summon a creature from somewhere else. To specify a creature, a true name must be added to the ritual. If a name is not added, then this call will be answered by whomever or whatever happens to be around.

                Place your arcane sigil on a material possession of a deceased target to bring their ghost forth. You may converse with them freely but the ghost can choose to leave if offended or bored.

                <p>
                Unlike rituals that require time and materials, Songs require the full participation of the creator. When singing a song, that is the only action you can take, and the song lasts for as long as you can keep it going, though some have effects that take place right away and don’t require you to keep singing. A song will list its name, its cost, and how much it costs to keep singing it if it’s a prolonged effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                Songs do not need to be vocalized, they can be played on instruments, or danced. Some even meditate and become the conduit for the music to surround them. How you create your songs is up to you.

                <strong>Distractions</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Since the songs are performances, keeping concentration can become important. If someone tackles you, grapples you, or otherwise attacks you to distract you, roll a saving throw to keep concentration. Other distractions might become important in certain contexts, such as a loud noise that pull attention from the song, or a plethora of other situations. The GM will decide if a particular distraction is enough to warrant a saving throw.

                <p>
                This functions the same as learning other things, by filling in segments of an easy clock until it’s full. Unlike some more complicated forms of learning, all it takes to fill in a segment is to continue practicing. The hardest part is finding any of the songs in written form, or finding the magical being who is willing to teach such powerful magic.

                <strong>Cost?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The coin cost for songs is a gift to the spirits. The coins vanish or are gifted through your own ritual to the ether. If a cost is ignored, roll Luck to see if a spirit corrupts your song or steals your performance.

                To speak the words of the dragons is to speak the language of nightmares. Draconic words cost HP and are more powerful and harder to control. When spoken, the HP is taken from the speaker and the word takes effect immediately. It cannot be countered and all who hear the word are affected until they Save, accomplish the requirement listed with the word, or take the damage.

                Some spirits can be called upon. To manifest in this world again. As an ally. They are ancient and remember a world with Love. Summons cost a greater sacrifice of coin, health, or a unique item. But when paid, they stay with you until their energy run out and they must rest. Or until you dismiss them.

                Summons dwell in the planes that overlap our own or just beyond this world, in the atmosphere. Other worlds. Only at their temples can be contacted. And only those that prove themselves worthy of receiving their true name will be able to summon them. This is more than a skill check or a saving throw. This is something you must figure out on your own. Becoming a summoner is a rare and dangerous feat.

With him comes the twilight hours, the sun descending in his presence and allowing his shadow hounds to join him. They can track anything you’ve seen or touched by entering your shadow and rummaging through your memories. Once they have the scent, the disgraced prince returns to his world and leaves the hound until you’ve reached your destination.

You must find the lost signal up in the atmosphere and allow it into your mind. Once connected, all the information you seek will be given to you. Each question you want answered will fill an inventory slot until the information is used.

It lets you fly like a shooting star. The halo will be consumed when you are close to death, saving you and replenishing all hp and death boxes. It can also be bestowed to someone freshly dead to bring them back to life, replacing their heart with a ball of fire that needs stoked and cared for.

                The empire believes it can make people psychic. It kidnaps children into its military facilities and does whatever it can hide from the public, whatever it can justify in the name of the “greater good.” It’s worked a few times. And so they continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                Songbirds can unlock latent psychic abilities through the traumatic experience of taking massive damage and surviving. Even then it’s a rare occurrence. When “blue shift” is rolled, a Songbird can do psychic stuff, such as: reading surface level thoughts, lifting objects with their mind, spontaneously combusting things, entering dreams, and shielding themselves and others from other psychics or tracking magics.
                </p>
                <p>
                They can just do those things. To an extent. Whenever a psychic does something extraneous, dangerous, or otherwise BIG, they overheat. Literally. Sparking a fever and causing a psychic backlash. Examples of “big” things includes: lifting large objects, reading deeper thoughts without permission, puppetting living things, turning a building into a bonfire, rending limb from torso, etc.

                <p>
                Our planet is a cold one, spending the majority of the year in Cholia, the season where the winds cease and the snow falls. Lakes freeze and the plants shrivel and hide. The quiet season. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Oolane is when things thaw and harvests begin. The winds roar out from the sea, bringing with them rains and thunder. The biggest, darkest clouds cover the land and lightning dances between the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                Esoon is a time of gray and fog and consistent drizzle. The muddy months. The months where crops are plucked and picked and collected. The winds are cold off the seas as they begin to freeze themselves shut.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Blue Moon is a week that lands outside of every year, between Sevris and Lunus. During this time the moon’s hue is a dull blue. It’s considered the time of the wyrd, where the world is not itself and neither are we.
                </p>
                <h3 id="segments">Segments</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                A day is segmented into three pieces, morning, evening, and night. A Songbird can accomplish one big task during each of these segments, with sleep being required for one. Big tasks are things like travel, exploration, dungeon crawling, downtime, and rest. Things take longer than you’d expect, and if you’ve ever struggled with the limited time in your weekend, you can understand how even something like “house maintenance” can be a weekend-long ordeal.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong id="golden-rule">The Golden Rule</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The golden rule of Songbirds is that, between sessions, game time passes at the same rate as our real world time. A typical Songbirds campaign will feature a session or two of adventure followed by the characters resting and going about daily life in the meantime, only to cover bigger downtime events and find the next adventure in the following session. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="rest">Rest</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                When Songbirds are resting, they are in a comfortable place, such as their City apartment, a hotel, or some settlement. While doing this they recover 1hp per day that passes and can erase one marked death box per day. Resting to a Songbird means the same thing it means to us: catching up with friends, enjoying some solitary time, practicing at a hobby, or watching a movie. It’s chill, low-effort, and not extraneous. They’re “off the clock,” so to speak.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong id="silver-rule">The Silver Rule</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Not every session will end neatly. Sometimes they end abruptly or an adventure is broken up between several sessions. When that’s the case, each Songbird makes a Return roll, D20 + Kinship against DC10. This single roll represents the Songbird returning to the nearest settlement or the City for rest, allowing them to replenish supplies and hit points, as well as the return trip to the adventure so they can pick up where they left off. Failure means they lose 1hp from the return.
                </p>
                <h3 id="clocks">Clocks</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                A clock is divided into segments based on how difficult or long-form the task is. Easy clocks are four segments, medium clocks are six segments, and hard clocks are eight segments. Different downtime actions will say when to make a clock and when to fill in a segment. When a clock is full, the task is complete and you can claim your reward.
                </p>
                <p>
                Whenever a player has a goal, such as learning a new skill or whatever, make a clock for it. And whenever they spend time working on that thing, during downtime or during an adventure, mark the clock. When they do the same thing repeatedly, limit filling it to at least one in-game day, or once per session. If they come up with cool and interesting ways to work towards the goal, fill in more per in-game day or session.
                </p>
                <h3 id="downtime">Downtime</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                These are some example actions that can be taken in the City or the safety of a settlement. They each take up a segment of time.

                <p>
                <strong>Cavorting</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                When you spend a night on the town and carouse, roll a d10 and send that much coin. If it’s equal to or lower than your PHY, it’s a rousing good time. Recover a death box. If it’s higher than your PHY, do the same but roll d10 below to see what horrible circumstances your partying got you into.
                </p>
                <ol>
                
                <li>Random bar brawl! Roll a PHY check or lose 1hp.
                
                <li>New tattoo! Roll a save. Success and it's super cool, failure and it's really embarrassing.
                
                <li>Invest all your spare coins in a scheme. Roll a save. Success and your money is doubled. Failure and you lose it all.
                
                <li>Drank too much. Roll a Save or begin the session intoxicated (-2 to all rolls and no proficiency/expertise).
                
                <li>Went for a walk. You wake up far, far away from your place. Pay d10 coins to get home.
                
                <li>Robbed! Roll d10. You lose whatever item is in that slot of your bag.
                
                <li>Imprisonment! Locked up until d10 x 10 coins are paid in fines.
                
                <li>You said something to the wrong magician and now you're under a geas to accomplish some silly quest.
                
                <li>What did you drink? You're under the effects of a random potion.
                
                <li>Who’s that? Wake up in bed next to someone you don’t recognize. Roll a save to see if they’re cool or not.

                <strong>Contact</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                To make new contacts or maintain old contacts, start a clock for the contact and fill in a segment. When the clock is full, the contact will trust you enough to do a favor for you. This could be anything from lending you coins, going traveling with you, or giving you protected information. The more important the contact, the harder the clock.

                <strong>Crafting</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                To craft items, pay d10 coins for materials, start a clock for it and roll a check using whatever skill is applicable. The difficulty is determined based on what is being crafted. Success means you mark a segment. Failure means you need to find help to continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Creating</strong>

                <p>
                Taking an action to create something, whether artistic or practical, but not a piece of gear or equipment, means you have to pay d10 coins for materials. Then roll a check against a DC below and fill in an easy clock for it.

                Finding a True Name is always a hard clock and requires unique methods of research for every segment. These are hardly ever recorded, and when they are, their sources are obscure, untranslated, and ancient.

                <p>
                Songbirds can repair their armor by spending 1c for supplies and taking the time to sit and mend. One segment of time is enough to repair d10hp of a piece of armor.

                <p>
                You can spend time purchasing items and other things from the equipment section. If you’re looking for something specific, the GM can call for a save or a more specific skill check to determine if the item is nearby.

                <em>Quick Magic Shop</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                When the players want a magic shop, ask them what items they would buy if they could. If they list stuff in the book, write it down. If they come up with something new, write it down. Make a list. Then show them the “default magic shop.” Everything inside costs 1,000 coins, or you can trade enough interesting items to the shop owner. They have the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                
                <li>+1 Sword, +3 against a favored enemy. Sword has a place to write its cool name.
                
                <li>Animated shield - floats near the owner and grants 1 Armor.
                
                <li>Slaying Arrow - it has a spot to write a true name. Hitting that target with this arrow kills them.
                
                <li>Immovable Rod - a rod that becomes stationary in space when activated.
                
                <li>Sovereign Glue - one use, can and will stick to anything its applied to forever.
                
                <li>Invisibility Cloak - makes the wearer invisible.
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Whenever they buy something, replace it with one of the items you wrote down before.

                <strong>Training</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                To train at a skill requires someone to train you with it. To fill in a piece of the clock, a training scene must be discussed/role-played between the trainer and trainee. Then the trainee rolls a check with the Stat the Skill falls under. Normal difficulty. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Gaining proficiency is a simple clock. And gaining expertise is a difficult one.

                <p>
                Traveling through a hex might not reveal anything. The hexes are large and vast and hide many secrets. You can take a segment to explore a hex carefully on foot. Doing so reveals the first tier of information for a hex, such as: the most prominent landmark, a local village, the closest dungeon, or possible treasure. Be careful! Some hexes may require more than one segment of exploration to uncover its secrets.

                <strong>Ancient Forest</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The ground cracks and crumbles, opening up into the ancient forest that lies below. Decades of fungal growth suffocated the canopy and solidified it. Beneath lies pale, white pillars of wood that hold the modern world up, and a sparse growth of brush. The purest water flows from underground streams. Termites the size of children burrow mazes through the massive trunks.

                <p>
                A stone plinth rises from a mound of earth. Blue blood dries on the chained corpse of a man. His eyes are open to the canopy above, but reflect the blue moon. If disturbed, he glows blue and speaks a prophecy (roll to see what’s in the next hex).

                Dirty, brown grass grows in clumps around vicious, man-eating plants. The land has refused mortal efforts to reclaim it. The land hates and wants nothing more than to die. If another action is spent exploring this hex, the terraforming machine sits in the middle, still idling. If shut down, the hex will return to a neutral state.

                A cave or other roofed structure where a pack of wolves rest. A Volfe can vouch for a group of mortals to ensure safe passage and a place to stay in this, or an adjacent hex. If not, all random encounters in this hex include d10+1 wolves as well.

                <p>
                Fortles are massive, magical envoys through the Astral Sea. They form when a magician binds its spirit with a tortoise. The tortoise grows large and sprouts a structure from its mighty shell: a tower, a fort, or a home. When adrift at sea, these Fortles are called “living islands.” Roll d10 when encountering one:
                </p>
                <p>
                1-6. Empty, abandoned.

                <p>
                The Lookouts carry on the legacy started long before the Songbirds. Their towers rest on hills, in trees, and off the sides of mountains, watching over settlements and protecting the City. They are monster hunters and nightmare wranglers. They are always looking for assistance. Roll d10:

                <li>Away. The tower is empty, but lived in. Lookouts must be busy.
                
                <li>Active. The tower is alive with noise as Lookouts prepare for a hunt.

                <li>New tower. A group of Lookouts builds a new tower here. Most of them are still teenagers.

                Ancient magicians, or magicians of some prowess, will undertake the operation to etch and tattoo their rituals onto their own body, into their own skin, and sometimes onto the surface of their brain. There are very few Magi alive at any one time, but those that survive the operation gain access to magic in a powerful, instantaneous way. A Magus will have three random spells and mastery in three skills.

                <p>

                <p>
                Ancient stone pillars, carved with intricate runes. They commune with the moon and track its changes, glowing blue to shed guiding light during the darkest phases. Magicians of any caliber regain twice as much Mind while resting near a moon beacon.

                Tall-stalked flowers supporting a bulbous, white body, cratered like the moon, decorated by a multitude of navy blue pedals. When the pedals rub together they create a beautiful sound. Travelers mistake them for a distant choir. The voice-like quality of the sound becomes eerily human during the full moon.

                Fortles are massive, magical envoys through the Astral Sea. They form when a magician binds its spirit with a tortoise. The tortoise grows large and sprouts a structure from its mighty shell: a tower, a fort, or a home. When walking on land, these Fortles are called “moving castles.” Roll d10 when encountering one:

                <p>
                The mythic underworld, nightmares, or dungeons are areas of designated eldritch fuckery. Academics call them “planetary wounds.” They are paranormal and supernatural, much like the Songbirds who delve them. Dungeons can be completed, shut, and erased by clearing them of the spirits that haunt their halls. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="dungeon-rounds">Dungeon Rounds</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                When delving, time is tracked in dungeon rounds. These can cover the time it takes to search the room, have a chat, or interact with the room’s occupants (monster, object, or trap). A random encounter is rolled every dungeon turn, or, whenever a new room is entered.
                </p>

                Songbirds who do not abide by the silver rule will find their time distorted. Ending a session inside of a dungeon means that no time will pass for the Songbirds between sessions, while the outside world continues on. This can lead to situations where Songbirds delve one session, finish it the next, and leave the dungeon to find several weeks have passed.
                </p>
                <p>
                This temporal distortion leads to a sickness called the “blues.” The skin shades an off-blue, the stomach churns as it tries to catch up on the lost time, and the brain wriggles to make sense of it all. Those that suffer the blues are considered “mournful” and “poisoned” for the next day, and then can make a saving throw each day to shake it off.

                Darkness breathes and fills. It’s a force. It has weight. It can hide and harm. A settlement has lanterns. The City has Eco tech. Lights. Fire. Things that thin the darkness. Make it breathable and livable. Dungeons are the halls of the earth and rarely bear lights. The wilderness too is a dark mess when the sun is not out. Light is required to travel. Campfires are needed to hang on.

                <p>
                Whenever songbirds are in total darkness within a dungeon, the GM rolls a d10 and records the number. Every combat round or dungeon round that passes, the GM ticks the number down. If the number reaches 0, the Terrifying Presence enters the room. Turn order continues as normal, but at the end of every songbirds turn, the Terrifying Presence rolls on the table below.

                Financial stress is a great source of energy for angry spirits to feed on, so they send goblins to snatch wealth so they can hoard it beneath the earth. The coins gathered in a Nightmare might be from an array of different cultures. Some may even be extinct.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>1. Silver Crown</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The oldest silver coin, minted by King Stoic, the last king of the City. They feature a crown on one side, and a blank reverse. The words “under the eyes of the king” are etched around the edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>2. Bronze Scales</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The docks have their own currency and their own government that decides how they run things. To certify this union underneath the City’s government, the docks minted their own coins from the unrefined bronze the City used to pay them with. These coins carry a weight amongst sailors and pirates alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>3. Hierarch Silver</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                There haven’t been Lunar Hierarchs born since the King died. Still, Hierarch silver is considered the “most real” coin in circulation. They are limited and collector’s hoard them like no other. 
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>4. CS Gold</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                City Standard Gold is the newest money initiative and considered the default. These coins are many and found in every nook and cranny of the City, though their circulation beyond its walls is still in its infancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>5. Double Heads</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                A trick coin that was eventually adopted as part of the City Standard Initiative. These are copies of Hierarch Silver but feature the caricatures of two Hierarchs instead of the singular Hierarch on the heads and their symbol on the tails.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>6. Phoenix Tips</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                An old coin used in Fae times to allow passage to the moon. The single most rare coin in existence. When this is rolled, one character must make a Luck check to see if the entire amount is counterfeit. If not, Phoenix Tips are worth 10 coins each.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>7. Silver Serpents</strong>

                <strong>8. The Doct Script</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Rectangular-ish coins, flat and sharp at the edges. They are a heavy series of coin from a bygone era before the City stood at all. Worthless to all except the most devoted of collectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>9. Dragon Eyes</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The first human currency, used to exchange goods between fae and mortals. They are smooth rock-like coins, with a finger-sized hole carved out of them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>10. Fairy Bones</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The carved, iron bones of elves and other fae. Each “coin” is worth 100 CS Gold. Traded primarily amongst dragon slayers and the elder Songbirds.

                <p>
                Dungeons generate art on canvas, or stone, or wood. This naturally generated simulacrum of artistry is held up within the City, even above the most legendary of painters. Despite the debates, these pieces continue to sell. When a piece of art is found, roll d1000 (four d10s, each one representing a digit) to determine cost. 
                </p>
                <p>
                If all numbers rolled are the same (3333, 7777, etc) the painting is an entrance to a pocket dimension. High/low to see if it’s inhabited or vacant (could be a dungeon).

                If used on a human, it will work but part of you will become bestial. Make a hangman on your sheet. Add a body part each time the card is used on a fellow human. When the body is complete, you are lost to your beasthood and must serve the next holder of the card for your remaining life.

                <strong>Ring of Melancholia</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                One of the eight rings of sin. Carved from fairy bone and topped with one of Death’s tears, crystalized.  No matter where you go, a fog will follow. Everyone within the fog is slowly taken by melancholy. First a general sadness, then fatigue, and then bed-stricken malaise.
                </p>
                <p>
                For each person affected by the fog, you gain 1 permanent hit point. All who die from the fog rise to serve you.

                <p>
                A standard, green backpack. It can hold 10 inventory slots inside. Every week, an inventory slot folds in on itself. To get the item in that slot, you must enter the bookbag. 
                </p>
                <p>
                When all slots have folded, they fold again. Inside the bookbag, non-euclidian hallways etch into an abyssal pocket dimension. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Time inside the bookbag is warped. For ever fold of an inventory slot, an extra hour passes in the world while you’re inside the bookbag.

                These keys are made from princess bones. An old fairy tradition. When touched to a lock, the lock reshapes itself to fit the skeleton key. If used on a door there is a 1-in-6 chance that the door opens to the House of Bones, a strange nightmare of Death. Where all princesses are lost for eternity.

                A conflict is any moment that is tense or dangerous. Any moment where things go slow motion and every moment matters. During conflict, time is measured in rounds. A round allows a person to move (closer or further from something), perform a minor action (such as removing an item from inventory or opening a door), and take an action.

                The daughters of dragons. The fiercest protectors and worshipers of the land and its rivers. To disrespect the waters is to suffer their wrath. Villages near rivers, lakes, and swamps will snare extra critters to give as gifts to these reptilian queens.

                Raccoons grown human-sized in their unnaturally long life. Stalk settlements, listening to human squabbles and exacerbate those squabbles through mischief: stealing goods, moving things around, and etching sloppy letters. Their cursed snickers echo from the shadows.

                <p>
                Weird semi-reconstructions of humans. Forged in the dungeons and the dreams of the moon. Easy to overlook if you’re not paying attention. Seek to kill and replace their original image. Their remains must be burnt at night or they will return.

                <h3>Dragons</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                Colossal, antlered, lung dragons with seven sets of legs. They can be feathered or scaled. Immortal spirits. Invincible. Born from a mortal who ingests a fallen star and has the legacy to survive the transformation. Their tears contain their memories. Their claws, scales, and horns shed and fall as gifts to the lands they inhabit.
                </p>
                <p>
                Dragon’s reflect their lands, becoming poisoned by massive toxic thoughts from settlements and the destruction of the natural world. When a well regarded person dies in their stead, the dragon will shed a tear for them, which embeds into the land as living art. Many people outside of the empire believe that if a dragon eats your corpse you will pass gently to the afterlife.
                </p>
                <p>
                A dragon can give up its life to become part of the land, only doing this when their lands are truly suffering, becoming a river, a mountain, or some other formation that hopefully ends the strife. Dragons are attracted to and protective of fallen stars. These are their eggs.
                </p>
                <p>
                When you first see a dragon you gain a permanent point of Lore.
                </p>
                <h3>Ecos</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                The precursor species that inhabited the planet before humans. Tall, monochromatic humanoids with elongated forearms, and holographic eyes (like a cat’s eyes in the night). They created and left behind eco tech, a magi-tech powered by a unique liquid energy that has led to the industrialization and advances of human society. 
                </p>
                <p>
                They are immortal, but as they age their organs polymorph into critters and other animals, escaping from their body as they become part of the land. The prevailing theory found within the Book of Ool is that they fled to the stars, even making a city on the dark side of the moon. 
                </p>
                <p>
                If you ever meet an Eco you gain a permanent point of Reflex.

Razing settlements, gathering prisoners of war, and performing executions on the Queen’s biggest detractors.

                Large, mutated snails with armored shells and several flail growths where eyes would go. Attracted to settlements, roads, and other constructions left in the wilderness. They smash and smash until nothing is left and move on to the next.

                Swords possessed by the spirits of those who wielded them. The longer they are left in this world, the more they grow flesh and eyes and arms. The remains must be buried properly, naming the spirit of the possessor, or the sword will return.

                <p>
                When the rich abuse and brutalize their staff, they condemn their poor spirits to the buildings they work in. Gargoyles are the angered workers and laborers of large manors, castles, and forts. They seek to destroy, murder, and eat those who subjugated them. Their remains must be brought to their actual homes, wherever they lived, and buried or the gargoyles reform.

                <p>
                Massive humanoids. Naked. Sleeping. Their skin is warm and alive but uncuttable by mortal blades. Impenetrable. They become the land in their long slumber, only causing trouble with their coughs, sneezes, farts, or as they shift to get comfortable.

                Spirits that inhabit objects. Like pots, pans, rocks, etc. Almost any little thing can become a goblin if a spirit fancies it. These are often the spirits of children, or jovial elders. They’ve found the fun in spirithood is playing pranks on the living and general tomfoolery. They are never out to kill or even harm severely. They just want to have a laugh.

                Someone without a home or trying to return to home. Possibly lost. Without an escort or a caravan or company they are taking a big risk in the wilderness. Roll high/low to see if they’re hungry and roll a reaction roll to see how they feel. Flees from violence.

                <p>
                Sometimes Death hears your thoughts. Sees your dreams. And creates your nightmares. A corpse that looks like you, lying mangled in your path. The image of your friend, massacred. Maybe a warning for a trap up ahead. Maybe a moment of sympathy from our sleeping god. But horrifying nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                When you encounter a visage, roll another random encounter to see how the visage died. Then save. Success means you gain a permanent point of Charisma. Failure means you are horrified until calmed.

                <p>
                Buildings can come alive if they’re the subject to several deaths. Rapid deaths. Or massive deaths. Places of natural disaster. Buildings that have collapsed. The spirits congeal and inhabit the building. Behind the wood and plaster walls are organs and arms that grab. To put a Wall of Flesh to rest, the people killed must be given a proper burial. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Buildings that come alive become non-euclidean. Hallways build into the space of the dead’s lives. Their dreams and hopes and memories. The building is a museum of them. A museum that doesn’t like intruders.

                Attacks all targets for d10.

                <h3>War Machines</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                Eco tech. Their bio-machines. Not originally built for war but repurposed by the Queen to spread destruction. Mechs and tanks. Ballistics. Autonomous killing drones. Those left for long enough in the wastes lose track of whatever their object was and roam quest-less, looking for a directive.

                HP - Limbs 3d10 (up to 8), torso 6d10, head 3d10

                <h3>Whales</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                The sea herself. The singers of her songs. The big shapes under the water. The keepers of ancient lore. The myth goes that Saint Morose was swallowed by a whale and ate it from the inside, devouring its brain to learn sacred knowledge. Then used that knowledge to kill Love.
                </p>
                <p>
                Coastal civilizations worship the whale and praise when one is beached and they can partake of its flesh. They use every piece of the whale, leaving nothing to waste. They thank the sea for this gift, but quietly as to not wake her.

                Memory - you can’t hold a tune.

                <h3>Will-o-wisps</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                Small spirits. Balls of light that suffered horrible deaths and now feed off pain and suffering. They lead the living into traps, into dangers, and other beasts. If a will-o-wisp touches you, it drains a death box from you. They wait for you to be on death’s door then swirl around you, chuckling all the while.

                <h3>Wolf</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                They speak the ancient tongue. Remember a time before us. Before Ecos. They know the truth and will never share it. Their eyes can mark you for life. The Eco believed they were their fathers. The fathers of all of us. Leaving gifts for them and following them wherever they led.

                Attacks single target for d10.
                </p>
                <p>
                When more than one wolf works together, they make their attacks at the same time with a single roll, adding all of their damage dice together to tear a single target apart.
                </p>
                <h3>Wyrm</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                Mighty, mighty, devourers of the earth. Cavern carvers. Desert destroyers. They fell from the moon and are trapped here. Forever. They sense the sound of footsteps through the sand. They are disgusted by the rumble of machinery in their lands. They dance to the sound of two moon flowers swaying together. The first time you see a Wyrm, your Charisma permanently increases by 1.

                </p>
                <p>
                All structures and vehicles in its path, devouring them.
                </p>
                <h3>Wyvern</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                The twisted spirits of those who hunt dragons. Strike dragons. Try to poison dragons. When they die their spirits are trapped here and grow long and wiry. Scaly. Vicious and forever hungry. The only way they can find rest is to be devoured by the dragon that they sought to smite.

                All targets with fire breath for 2d10 each.

                <h3>Zombie</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                When a body isn’t given the proper rituals or burned, the spirit lies dormant until nightfall. Under the gaze of her. Our moon.

                <li>Into the Odd - this was the first OSR-related project I read that really opened my mind. My first game was a hack of it. It’s also where I got the idea to put bi-planes in my games.
                
                <li>Wonder & Wickedness - still my favorite arcane supplement. Best magic-related thing. My go-to.

                <li>Fallout New Vegas - the perks are genius and are a major inspiration when it comes to character creation.
                
                <li>Persona 5 - made me rethink the fun and enjoyment in downtime activities., and the dungeon-to-life balance.
                
                <li>Blades in the Dark - clocks are super useful when tracking random things. I like to use them for character growth outside of leveling, which has become a staple of my games over the last few years.
                
                <li>Red Giant - I blame this game for reigniting my love of Songbirds and daring me to make a third edition.
